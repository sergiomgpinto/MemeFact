Neither of the programs for migrants uses money from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, which is primarily used after natural disasters. Congress funds the migrant and disaster relief programs separately. FEMA is not out of money. The agency’s Disaster Relief Fund was facing a funding deficit before Hurricane Helene hit Sept. 26. This is not unusual; nearly every year since 2017, Congress has approved extra funding for the agency.",human,pro republican,redneck randal

The significant job losses in the manufacturing sector were largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to widespread business shutdowns. Under President Trump, there was a net job loss of 188,000 manufacturing jobs, but this occurred during the pandemic, not before it. The context of job losses and gains is complex, often tied to specific economic conditions rather than a straightforward narrative of job losses prior to the pandemic.",ai,pro democrat,monkey business
