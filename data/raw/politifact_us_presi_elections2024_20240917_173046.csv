The FBI said it is investigating the event as ""what appears to be an assassination attempt"" against Trump. The investigation is ongoing, but neither the FBI nor local authorities have said it was staged. Authorities recovered evidence, including an AK-47-style rifle, from a spot along the fence surrounding Trump’s golf course. The suspect has been arrested and charged with two federal gun crimes.","Soon after U.S. Secret Service agents intervened to stop a second assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump on Sept. 15, social media users started spreading conspiracy theories about the incident, including that it was staged. Some users pointed to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign sending fundraising emails hours after the incident as proof. ""Trump is fundraising from these shooting incidents, it's almost like these are staged,"" an X user posted Sept. 15. Another X user tagged Trump’s X account and wrote , ""I don't buy your story for a second. So vague, with so little detail trickling out, like you're making it up as you go. No footage, no real details. Yet somehow, you had fundraising emails ready to go in minutes? Feels completely staged."" Other users on X and Instagram made similar claims. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. These claims are baseless. The FBI said it is investigating the event as ""what appears to be an assassination attempt"" against Trump. As Trump golfed at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, a man pointed a gun through the fence and bushes at Trump, who was 400 to 500 yards away. Per safety protocols, a U.S. Secret Service agent was stationed one to two holes ahead of Trump. At about 1:30 p.m., the agent ahead of Trump noticed the rifle barrel pointed through the fence and fired at the gunman, who drove away from the scene. Authorities later apprehended the suspect, whom they identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58. Trump’s campaign posted on X about an hour after the incident, saying Trump was ""safe following gunshots in his vicinity."" Trump himself posted on Truth Social that night thanking the Secret Service and local law enforcement for ""the incredible job done today."" Court documents said authorities recovered an AK-47-style rifle equipped with a scope, two bags, a digital camera and a black plastic bag containing food from the spot Routh had positioned himself along the fence surrounding Trump’s golf course. Officials shared photos of the evidence with news outlets during the press conference. Court filings show Routh was charged with two federal crimes: possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Claims that violent incidents and shootings were ""staged"" to distract from other news are a common trope among misinformers. In July, when a gunman opened fire on Trump during a Butler, Pennsylvania, campaign rally and a bullet grazed Trump’s ear, social media users also falsely claimed that assassination attempt was staged . Our ruling Social media users claimed the apparent assassination attempt against Trump on Sept. 15 was ""staged."" There is no evidence to support this. The FBI is investigating the incident as a potential assassination attempt against the former president. Authorities recovered evidence, including a rifle, after the event, and the suspect has been charged with federal gun crimes. This claim is inaccurate and meritless. We rate it Pants on Fire! "

"September 13, 2024",Instagram posts,"""Debate moderators made the false claim to Donald Trump that there is nowhere in the United States where abortion is legal up until birth.""",false,"ABC News debate moderator Linsey Davis fact-checked a false claim by former President Donald Trump, who said Democrats support aborting babies after birth. Davis correctly pointed out that killing a baby after it is born is illegal in all 50 states.","ABC News debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis have received criticism from former President Donald Trump and other conservatives for fact-checking Trump several times during his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. One social media user criticized Davis’ fact-checking Trump on abortion, but put words in her mouth. ""Last night during the ABC debate, two of the participants, otherwise known as the moderators of the debate, made the false claim to Donald Trump that there is nowhere in the United States where abortion is legal up until birth,"" a man said in a Sept. 11 Instagram video . ""Unfortunately for ABC, this is their own graphic which clearly shows if you read right here, the states in dark green have no restrictions based on gestational age,"" the speaker said. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. The video showed a June 2023 ABC News graphic that has since been updated to include three additional states that have no restrictions based on gestational age. But ABC’s fact-check of Trump on abortion was not about state restrictions on gestational age. The Instagram post criticizes a fact-check that Davis didn’t make, a transcript and video of the exchange shows. The exchange began when Davis asked Trump why women voters should trust him about reproductive rights policy when he has changed his position on abortion. Most recently, Davis noted, Trump said he supports Florida’s six-week abortion ban, which he previously said was too brief. Trump responded by falsely accusing Democrats and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, of supporting postbirth abortions. ""Well, the reason I'm doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia, not the current governor, who's doing an excellent job, but the governor before. He said the baby will be born and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we'll execute the baby. ""And that's why I did that, because that predominates. Because they're radical. The Democrats are radical in that. And her vice presidential pick, which I think was a horrible pick, by the way for our country, because he is really out of it. But her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth, it's execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born, is OK. And that's not OK with me. Hence the vote. But what I did is something for 52 years they've been trying to get Roe v. Wade into the states."" Trump mistakenly referred to West Virginia’s governor, when he meant Virginia’s Democratic former governor, Ralph Northam. Trump has repeatedly misstated Northam’s 2019 comments about abortion to claim Northam approves of executing babies. And The Washington Post found that Harris’ running mate Gov. Tim Walz has made no such statements about abortion or ""execution after birth."" Trump went on for a few more moments in the debate, then Davis concisely fact-checked Trump’s claim about post-birth abortions. ""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born,"" Davis said, before turning to Harris for a response. As PolitiFact has reported before , willfully killing a newborn child is infanticide and illegal in all 50 states. Fetal deaths in the third trimester are exceedingly rare and usually involve emergencies such as fatal anomalies or life-threatening complications affecting the mother, health experts have said. For fetuses with very short life expectancies, doctors may induce labor and offer palliative care to make the newborn as comfortable as possible. Neither moderator fact-checked Trump again on abortion for the rest of the debate. An Instagram post claiming a moderator falsely told Trump ""that there is nowhere in the United States where abortion is legal up until birth"" misstates what Davis said. She corrected Trump’s false claim that Democrats support ""executing"" babies after birth, which is illegal. We rate the Instagram post False. "

(Lea más sobre nuestra colaboración con Meta , propietaria de Facebook e Instagram). Pero la declaración de que Harris uso pendientes con audífonos es errónea. Los pendientes NOVA H1 y los que Harris llevaba durante el debate pueden parecer similares debido a que ambos diseños tienen una perla, pero al examinarlos más de cerca, se nota que tienen diferencias importantes. Los zarcillos de audio NOVA H1 fueron introducidos por la compañía como l os primeros en tener audífonos inalámbricos . A diferencia de los audífonos tradicionales, los zarcillos audífonos se colocan en el lóbulo de la oreja, no dentro de la oreja, y utilizan "" tecnología de sonido direccional "" para llevar el audio al oído, dijo la compañía. La página web del producto muestra dos versiones , una en plata y una en oro. Ambas versiones tienen una perla y un tallo grueso que se ajusta alrededor del lóbulo de la oreja. Malte Iversen, CEO de Icebach Sound Solutions, la compañía que produjo los zarcillos NOVA H1, le dijo a PolitiFact en un correo electrónico juguetón ""nosotros no sabemos"" si Harris usó uno de los productos de su compañía. La página de Icebach Sound Solutions dice que una ""edición especial para los debates presidenciales"" va a estar disponible pronto; Iversen le dijo a PolitiFact que el producto se agotó. La página web también dice que dada la atención que recibieron después del debate, la compañía dará una entrevista a Jimmy Fallon, el presentador del The Tonight Show, para ""aclarar los rumores y mitos alrededor de su maravilloso producto"". No hay evidencia de que Harris usó los aretes NOVA H1. Harris llevaba aretes con dos líneas más finas — como un imperdible doblado por la mitad, con la perla como cabeza.

"September 11, 2024",Kamala Harris,"“As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone, in any war zone around the world, for the first time this century.”",barely-true,"A Defense Department spokesperson told PolitiFact that the U.S. is not currently engaged in a war, nor does the U.S. military have service members fighting in any active war zones. However, some U.S. military service members are stationed in areas the U.S. government recognizes as combat zones. In 2024 alone, several U.S. service members have been killed or injured during military operations abroad.","The first 2024 presidential election debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump touched on many issues, including U.S. military activity abroad. ABC News moderators asked Harris whether she believed she bore any responsibility for the way the U.S. military withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021. Thirteen U.S. service members were killed in an attack during the withdrawal. Harris said she agreed with President Joe Biden’s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan. ""Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did,"" Harris said . ""And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone, in any war zone around the world, first time this century."" When we contacted Harris’ presidential campaign for evidence to support this statement, a spokesperson referred us to the Defense Department. A Defense Department spokesperson told PolitiFact that the U.S. is neither engaged in a war, nor has service members fighting in active war zones anywhere in the world. ""An aspect of military service includes serving in locations where hostile actions may occur,"" the Defense Department official said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""Those locations are designated by executive order and/or the Secretary of Defense. However, it’s important to note that just because a service member is in one of these locations does not mean they are engaged in war."" But Harris’ inclusion of ""combat zone"" in that statement is misleading and experts said it significantly underplays the broader landscape of active duty military service abroad. The Internal Revenue Service tracks combat zones for tax purposes. The term generally refers to ""hostile areas where (the) military may serve, (including) actual combat areas, direct combat support areas and qualified hazardous duty areas,"" the IRS said on a webpage last reviewed and updated Aug. 19. Citing the Defense Department, the IRS said that as of August, recognized combat zones included the Sinai Peninsula, and the Afghanistan, Kosovo and Arabian Peninsula areas. Melanie Sisson, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, a think tank, said some of these combat zone designations, such as the one over Kosovo, are ""holdovers"" from previous U.S. military operations. But the combat zones do include areas in which U.S. service members are now deployed, she said. PolitiFact asked the Defense Department for a list of places within the designated combat zones that U.S. military service members are serving in, but we did not receive a response before publication. As of June, the nonpartisan think tank Council on Foreign Relations said the U.S. had several thousand service members stationed across multiple foreign countries and on ships at sea in the Middle East. Many of these countries are in the currently recognized combat zones listed on the IRS website . Specifically, the Defense Department and news outlets have reported that there are about 2,500 U.S. service members in Iraq and about 900 in Syria , fighting against Islamic State militants. Additionally, thousands of U.S. service members have been deployed to the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war started in October 2023. There have been multiple instances this year in which U.S. service members have been killed or injured while serving abroad. In January, three U.S. Army Reserve soldiers were killed and at least 34 others were injured in a drone strike in Jordan. In February, two U.S. Navy SEALs drowned during an Iranian weapons seizure mission. In August, eight U.S. service members were wounded in a drone attack in Syria. That same month, another seven U.S. service members were injured in a raid targeting Islamic State militants. ""It is not accurate to suggest that U.S. service members are not, today, in harm’s way,"" Sisson said. Peter Feaver, a Duke University political science professor who specializes in civil-military relations, echoed Sisson, saying many U.S. military personnel are engaged in operations ""that put them at serious risk of attack by adversaries."" ""For the men and women serving on these and many other missions, not to mention their families and loved ones, this feels very much like serving in a combat zone,"" Feaver said. Our ruling Harris said, ""As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone, in any war zone around the world, for the first time this century."" The Defense Department confirmed the U.S. military is not engaged in a war. But Harris’ statement ignores critical facts. There are thousands of U.S. military service members stationed in areas that are considered combat zones. These members face hostilities from foreign adversaries and some have been killed or injured during military operations. We rate Harris’ statement Mostly False.  "

Box, a relative’s home or a nonprofit group’s address where they can receive mail.","A video of a Dallas County Elections Department training class in Texas is being falsely shared online as evidence of voter fraud. A Sept. 9 X post with a grammatical and a spelling error said, ""Dallas County Texas Tell Election Workers To ILLEGALY LIE ON REGISTRATION & USE A CHURCH ADDRESS TO REGISTER HOMELESS PEOPLE TO VOTE!"" The post was written by John Basham, who the Dallas Morning News reported is a former Reno, Texas, city council member. The ""Video Was Recorded August 24th During Election Training By Dallas County Elections Dept.,"" Basham wrote, linking to an X post with the same video from conservative media personality Joe Hoft. Basham’s post had more than 60,000 likes and 2.7 million views by Sept. 11, according to X. We contacted Basham through an X message but received no response. We found other social media posts sharing the same video and language used in Basham’s post. In the 34-second video Basham shared, a woman seated in a classroom setting asked, ""So we should just put the church address because that’s where they come?"" Someone off camera responded: ""Where do they sleep?"" the person asked. ""On the street,"" the woman responded. ""They sleep right outside the church."" ""That’s the residence address,"" the person off camera said. ""If they sleep in that area, give a description, that’s the residence address. You have to … include a mailing address. If the church has a box that she’s going to share with them, the box is fine. That’s the mailing address."" What the people described is perfectly legal under Texas law. The Dallas County Elections Department released a Sept. 10 statement in response to what it called ""misinformation"" in the social media posts. ""These claims falsely imply that legally protected voter registration practices are acts of voter fraud,"" the statement said. ""State law is very clear: having a home is not a requirement to be eligible to register to vote, and voters can use an address other than their residential address as a mailing address."" Dallas County Elections Administrator Heider Garcia said voting eligibility requirements are clearly defined in state law. ""Our unhoused population in Dallas County, many of whom are veterans, deserve to be treated like every other voter who is allowed to use an alternate mailing address,"" Garcia said in the statement. The state law that Garcia referred to, which was also cited in a community note on Basham’s post, says in Sec. 13.002 of the election code that a voter application must include the applicant’s residence address, ""or, if the residence has no address, the address at which the applicant receives mail and a concise description of the location of the applicant ’s residence."" ""The law is crystal clear on this, a person does not lose their right to vote when they experience homelessness,"" said Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of Common Cause Texas, a voting rights advocacy group. ""Texas law explicitly allows a person experiencing homelessness to use an alternate mailing address."" TexasLawHelp.org, an effort by Texas legal aid organizations and foundations, courts, and nonprofits to provide free, reliable legal information to low-income Texans, described on its website how unhoused people can register to vote in the state. Such voters ""can include the address where you sleep most often as the place you ‘reside.’ this can be a shelter address, a park address, or even a street corner."" Homeless voters must also provide a valid mailing address. That can be a post office box, or some shelters and nonprofit organizations may allow them to use their addresses to receive mail, the website said. Texas’ law regarding homeless voters is in line with other states, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless, a national advocacy group for the homeless. A webpage for the group’s ""You Don’t Need a Home to Vote"" campaign said, ""Many individuals, homeless or otherwise, aren’t even aware that no state requires residents to have a traditional residence in order to vote in elections."" A separate webpage specific to Texas said homeless voters must provide an address where they can receive mail, such as a shelter, service provider or relative, but a residential address can be wherever they usually reside, such as a park or street corner. Our ruling An X post said that Dallas County election workers were telling trainees to illegally lie on voter applications and use a church address to register voters. The Dallas County Election Department called this claim misinformation. It said state law is clear that you don’t need a home to vote, and that voters can use an address other than their residential address as a mailing address.

They're eating, they're eating the pets of the people that live there.”",pants-fire,"A Springfield, Ohio, city spokesperson, the mayor and city police all said claims that Haitian immigrants are stealing and eating residents’ pets are unfounded. The claims appear to have originated with unverified social media posts. Read a roundup of our fact-checks from the first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.","Former President Donald Trump at his Sept. 10 debate with Vice President Kamala Harris repeated a debunked claim that Haitian immigrants were eating people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio. ""In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating, they're eating the pets of the people that live there,"" Trump said as he attacked Harris and President Joe Biden’s immigration policies. Karen Graves, a Springfield spokesperson, told PolitiFact there are ""no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community."" Springfield police told a local news outlet the agency knew of no such reports about pets. The claim has gone viral in recent days, spread in part by high-profile conservatives, including Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio . X owner Elon Musk , Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas, the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee and conservative influencer Charlie Kirk shared claims similar to Trump’s on social media. Some of the social media claims mentioned immigrants killing ducks or geese, but Graves said there were no reports of that or other crimes that have recently been pinned on Haitian immigrants. Vance defended Trump’s claim in the spin room after the debate. He pointed reporters to a Sept. 10 article from conservative website The Federalist that included an Aug. 26 police report and audio recording from a caller to a communications center in Clark County, Ohio, where Springfield is. The caller reported a group of four Haitian people in Springfield, each carrying a goose. ""Whether they were eating geese or dogs, is that really what we’re going to hang our hat on?"" Vance said, The Washington Post reported . However, the city spokesperson said there were no reports to the city of ducks or geese being killed or other crimes that have recently been pinned on Haitian immigrants. Springfield Mayor Rob Rue at a Sept. 10 city commission meeting reiterated that there were no credible or specific claims about Haitian immigrants stealing and eating pets. ""Rumors like these are taking away from the real issues such as housing concerns, resources needed for our schools and our overwhelmed health care system,"" Rue said. Many of the social media posts that shared the claims relied on an account from an unidentified person shared in a private Facebook group that said its author’s neighbor’s daughter’s friend came home from work to find her cat butchered and hanging in a tree at a Haitian immigrant’s home next door. Trump campaign spokespeople did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment about Trump’s debate claim. Vance, in a follow-up X post Sept. 10, said his ""office has received many inquiries from actual residents of Springfield who’ve said their neighbors’ pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants."" Vance appeared to acknowledge that some reports may not be accurate, writing, ""It’s possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false."" But he also said in another follow-up post : ""Keep the cat memes flowing."" The influx of as many as 20,000 Haitian migrants in the community has sparked controversy, particularly in August 2023, after a Haitian immigrant without a valid Ohio driver’s license drove a minivan into a school bus, killing an 11-year-old boy, The New York Times reported . Since 2023, some Haitians have come to the U.S. through the Department of Homeland Security’s humanitarian parole program that lets people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and their immediate family members request to come to the United States legally. They can be paroled into the United States for up to two years. The Haitian immigrants using that program are in the U.S. legally, a Springfield city website notes. The language about Haitian immigrants eating family pets is similar to unfounded claims some conservatives shared earlier this year warning about gangs of Haitian cannibals that may be coming to the U.S. Experts told PolitiFact such narratives painting Haiti as a barbarous country are not new, and are racist attempts to dehumanize Haitians. Our ruling Trump said that in Springfield, Ohio, Haitian immigrants are ""eating the pets of the people that live there."" He doubled down on the claim after being corrected by debate moderator David Muir, despite multiple news outlets debunking the claim a day earlier and against the backdrop of rebuttals from Springfield city officials. The claim appears to stem from an unverified secondhand Facebook post. A city spokesperson and Springfield police said they have received no credible reports that pets are being abducted and eaten by the immigrants. Springfield’s mayor also said the claims are not credible at a Sept. 10 city commission meeting. We rate the claim Pants on Fire! "

"September 6, 2024",Kamala Harris,Project 2025 would defund K-12 schools.,half-true,"Project 2025, the 900-page conservative presidential transition document sponsored by the Heritage Foundation think tank, calls for eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, which would phase out some, if not all, federal aid to public K-12 schools. The project proposes transitioning some programs to the states over 10 years and cancels others it deems ineffective. Former President Donald Trump also supports abolishing the department. The federal government provided about 14% of public K-12 funding in fiscal year 2022, with most of the money going to programs to support disadvantaged, low-income students and students with disabilities. Although the majority of public schools receive most of their funds from state and local sources, education policy experts said that some states and districts that receive a greater share of federal aid would experience steep losses from the proposal.","Vice President Kamala Harris’ new campaign attack ad shuffles through the pages of Project 2025, calling it the ""922-page blueprint to make Donald Trump the most powerful president ever."" Former President Trump and his campaign have distanced themselves from the conservative presidential transition plan but Democrats continue to link him to it, highlighting Trump’s past ties to many of its contributors . The narrator in Harris’ ad ""Control"" repeats some claims about the document that we have covered before, such as ""requiring the government to monitor women’s pregnancies"" (it requires states to report abortions and miscarriages) and imposing ""severe cuts to Medicare and Social Security."" (Project 2025 calls for changes to Medicare, but does not support Social Security cuts.) The narrator says the manual calls for ""eliminating the Department of Education and defunding K-12 schools."" We have covered how Project 2025 dismantles the U.S. Department of Education as part of a push to have more ""limited"" federal involvement in school policy. Trump supports that move. For this fact-check, we wanted to know how Project 2025 would affect federal funding for public schools. Losing federal dollars wouldn’t zero out budgets for most districts. Public schools, with some exceptions, receive the majority of their funding from local and state governments. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government provided around 8% to 10% of K-12 school funding. COVID-19 relief funding pushed the share to about 14% in 2022, but it has expired. But the federal contribution still translates into billions of dollars, and states and school districts that receive a higher share of those dollars would feel a disproportionate hit. The Harris campaign pointed PolitiFact to Department of Education K-12 spending data. In fiscal year 2023 , the agency received $79.6 billion for K-12 funding; the money was earmarked primarily for programs to support special education and education for disadvantaged, low-income students, among other initiatives. The department’s 2023 budget — $274 billion — includes a large chunk for student loans and college aid, which includes income-based aid such as Pell Grants. In an emailed statement, Project 2025 told PolitiFact the fact that school budgets rely on federal money for only a small share of their funding means cutting the department ""hardly defunds schools."" The project proposes transitioning some programs to the states over 10 years and cancels others it deems ineffective. In a video about his education policy, Trump promised to shutter the department and ""to send all education work and needs back to the states."" He did not say how federal dollars would be redirected. His Republican National Convention platform also calls to cut federal funding ""for any school pushing critical race theory, radical gender ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content."" Trump’s campaign didn’t say how he would redirect lost federal dollars. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said his administration will improve ""academic excellence for all students from all educational backgrounds"" by ""increasing access to school choice, empowering parents to have a voice in their child's education and supporting good schools and teachers."" Effects of eliminating the Department of Education Project 2025 calls for dismantling the Department of Education and transferring its Title I program , which helps fund schools with large populations of K-12 students from low-income families, to the Department of Health and Human Services. The plan aims to provide the funding in a block grant, giving states more flexibility on how to spend the money by being less prescriptive. The proposal phases out Title I over 10 years, shifting the funding responsibility to the states. The plan recommends a similar move for the department’s Individuals with Disabilities Education Act funding, converting the special education money that now goes to schools into HHS-run block grants for states to distribute to parents. What would happen next is hard to say, because state education spending varies widely. ""Some states might fund their own programs to help students in ways that are similar to what the federal programs do today,"" Holly Kurtz, director at EdWeek Research Center, and Sterling Lloyd, the center’s assistant director, told PolitiFact in a joint email. ""Other states could choose to go in a different direction with their spending."" Presidents could not do this on their own. Abolishing the department would require an act of Congress and bipartisan support, which has proved a long shot. ""Congress is one that decides the federal education budget, and the funding that’s in there is pretty popular on both sides of the aisle,"" said Marguerite Roza, director of Georgetown University’s Edunomics Lab. ""States can always say no thank you to federal funds and rules, and so far none have. Not one."" Trump made a similar campaign pledge to reduce the Education Department in 2016, but curtailed his plans once in office. His first budget for the 2018 fiscal year proposed cutting the department's budget by 13%, rather than calling for its elimination. Trump proposed similar spending cuts in his next two budgets; none were approved. The Department of Education’s role in K-12 schools The majority of K-12 public school funding money comes from state and local governments through a mix of state income taxes, state sales taxes and local property taxes. The amount of federal money flowing to schools varies across states and school districts. For example, Arkansas' federal share is 20%, South Dakota's is 21% and Mississippi’s is 23%. New York's is 7% and Massachusetts’ is 9%. Districts that serve more students from low-income families and students with disabilities would feel the brunt of federal funding cuts more severely than districts that serve fewer of those students. The hit could be substantial in large school districts such as Detroit, which has a 48% federal share, and Oklahoma City, where the share is 34%. Beyond providing some funding to schools, the Education Department also houses the National Center for Education Statistics, the nationwide data source on schools, and its Office for Civil Rights, which investigates thousands of allegations of discrimination and harassment in schools annually. Project 2025 would direct other agencies to absorb those responsibilities. It would move the school assessments and other research functions to the U.S. Census Bureau and have the Justice Department’s Office for Civil Rights absorb the Education Department’s office. Critics say these groups are already significantly underfunded. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights gets ""thousands of civil rights complaints each year that deal with allegations of race, sex and disability-based discrimination in schools across the country,"" said Robert Kim, executive director at the Education Law Center, a legal advocacy organization for public education. ""The office has been really underfunded for decades now and the work has exponentially increased."" ""Defund"" is open to interpretation Does cutting the federal share amount of ""defunding"" schools, as Harris’ ad says? The word can mean anything from cutting funds for schools to gutting it completely. Merriam-Webster’s definition of the word — ""to withdraw funding from"" — fits for Project 2025’s proposal. ""If the viewer of the advertisement interprets ‘defund’ to mean that schools would receive no more money, period, under Project 2025, then that is false,"" Kurtz and Sterling said. ""However, if the viewer interprets ‘defund’ to mean a reduction in funding to K12 schools, then the advertisement is true because Project 2025 does include initiatives that would reduce funding for K12 schools."" Sean Corcoran, a Vanderbilt University public policy and education professor, said shuttering the department ""would go far to defund a lot of schools."" Frederick Hess, senior fellow and education policy studies director at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Project 2025 would ""absolutely not"" defund schools. ""Just for starters, 90% of K-12 educational funding is state and local,"" Hess said. ""Would Trump or Project 2025 marginally trim the rate of increase in public school spending? Possibly. (Project 2025) would block grant Title I (about 2% of school spending) and then theoretically keep reducing it over a decade."" Our ruling A Harris campaign ad said Project 2025 would defund K-12 schools. Eliminating the Department of Education would phase out some, if not all, federal funding for public K-12 schools and return that responsibility to the states. The federal government provided about 14% of K-12 funding in fiscal year 2022 with added COVID-19 funding that has expired. Most money goes to programs to support disadvantaged, low-income students and students with disabilities. The majority of schools receive most of their funds from state and local sources, education policy experts noted that some states and districts receive a greater share of federal aid and could face greater losses from the proposal. The ad’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.  "

But now some social media users are doing it for him — they say McDonald’s itself denied her employment story. ""MCDONALD’s CORPORATE has come forth and said they have no record whatsoever of KAMALA HARRIS ever working at any of their locations,"" an X post screenshot shared Aug. 31 on Facebook said. Other posts on Facebook , Instagram and Threads and X made similar claims. Some posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Screengrab from Facebook) But these posts are wrong: McDonald’s has issued no such statement. Harris has mentioned her job at McDonald’s on the campaign trail and in other public appearances. Her campaign told PolitiFact that Harris worked the cash register and staffed the fry and ice cream machines at a McDonald’s in Alameda, California, in summer 1983. Harris attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., from 1982 to 1986. We searched McDonald’s Corp.’s website and social media accounts and found no public statements from the company about Harris’ work experience there. We also found no news coverage of such a statement from the company. PolitiFact contacted McDonald’s about this claim but did not receive a response before publication. When we asked Trump’s campaign for evidence, spokesperson Anna Kelly told PolitiFact, ""Kamala Harris said that she paid her way through college by working at McDonald's. Why won’t she prove it?"" Trump’s campaign also pointed to an Aug. 29 article from the conservative Washington Free Beacon that said Harris did not mention her McDonald’s job in her books or on a 1987 resume. The article did not cite evidence disproving Harris’ work experience there. What we know about Harris’ McDonald’s job Harris has not talked extensively about her job at McDonald’s when she was a college student, but since the 2024 presidential campaign started, the mentions have become more frequent. The earliest instance PolitiFact could find of Harris talking about her McDonald’s job is from 2019, when Harris marched with striking McDonald’s workers in Las Vegas. At the time, Harris was a Democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election. ""I worked in McDonald’s. I was a student when I was working in McDonald’s. There was not a family relying on me to pay the rent, put food on the table and keep the bills paid by the end of the month,"" Harris said in 2019. In April, before Harris launched her 2024 presidential campaign, she talked about working at the fast food chain on ""The Drew Barrymore Show."" Harris said she ""did fries"" and worked as a cashier. She said her go-to order is a ""quarter-pounder with cheese and fries"" and her favorite dipping sauce for McNuggets is barbecue. Since launching her 2024 presidential campaign in July, Harris has highlighted her summer job at McDonald’s in campaign ads and on her personal and campaign X accounts. A pro-Harris political group also touted her McDonald’s job in an ad . ""Determination is how Kamala Harris went from working in McDonald’s to prosecutor, state attorney general, U.S. senator and our vice president in only one generation,"" one of her ads said. Harris’ running mate and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has also pointed on the campaign trail to Harris’ McDonald’s job. At the Aug. 13 American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Convention in Los Angeles, Walz talked about Harris’ middle-class upbringing and how she ""picked up shifts at that McDonald’s as a student."" There is no evidence that McDonald’s has called into question Harris’ work experience at the company.

Multiple images shared in the video were traced to unrelated incidents, including a car crash in Guam and images published in medical research journals.","On Sept. 2, a website styled to look like a news organization known as ""KBSF San Francisco News"" posted a story about a hit-and-run crash cover-up implicating Vice President Kamala Harris. Within two days, the baseless claims had spread widely on X. In video clips shared Sept. 4 on X, a woman identified as ""Alicia Brown"" claimed Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, drove a car that struck and injured her June 7, 2011. ""Well it happened on the corner of Post Street and Jones Street,"" the woman recounted. ""Me and my mom were walking home from the movie theater after watching ‘Pirates of the Caribbean.’"" She said a car driving the wrong way down a one-way street struck her as she crossed the road. She was thrown into the road, where she observed the woman who hit her looking back at her before driving away from the scene. ""Of course, back then, I didn’t know that it was Kamala Harris, California attorney general,"" the woman said. Harris was in her first year as attorney general in 2011. A voice-over said the woman injured her pelvis, ribs and spine in the crash and underwent 11 surgeries but never regained her ability to walk. The day after the incident, Brown said two men talked with her mom at the hospital. ""When my mom came back to me I asked, ‘Who are those people?’ She said that the woman who hit me was Kamala Harris, a very powerful woman and those men were her people,"" the woman said. ""She was told that if this story gets out we would be in very big trouble, and if she loves me, she shouldn’t report this or look for any justice."" The claim emerged from a blog post on a website identifying itself as ""KBSF San Francisco News."" That website was unresponsive by midday Sept. 4, but the source code on an archived version of the story showed that the video and the story were posted around 6 a.m. Sept. 2. By around 11 a.m. Sept. 3, the narrative was being amplified by a member of a pro-Donald Trump ""meme"" account network and paid subscribers on X. (Screenshot from archived KBSF-tv.com website) A woman and news station with no history, a crash with no documentation KBSF is not a reputable San Francisco news outlet. The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates television communications and maintains a register of TV stations, has no record of KBSF . The domain name www.kbsf-tv.com was created Aug. 20 . The video identified the woman as ""Alicia Brown,"" but the KBSF story that accompanied it also spelled Brown’s name ""Alisha Brown,"" so we checked that, too. We found no WhitePages.com records for a person living in San Francisco for either name. Google searches before Sept. 1 did not show an ""Alicia Brown"" or ""Alisha Brown"" in California who matched the woman in the video. The intersection of Post and Jones streets — where Brown said the purported incident occurred — exists. Google Maps confirmed the location was within walking distance of a movie theater in 2011. San Francisco Police Department spokesperson Allison Maxie said the agency found no calls for service or other reports involving a hit-and-run or car crash in the vicinity of the intersection of Post and Jones streets on or around this date in 2011. ""Our search for such an incident turned up with negative results,"" Maxie said. ""We believe there is no merit to this incident."" Because the woman in the video claimed her mother had been intimidated into silence, our search went beyond police records. We used Google and Nexis to search and found: No results in Nexis news archives for an ""Alicia Brown"" or ""Alisha Brown"" involved in a 2011 hit-and-run car crash in California. Four results when searching ""Kamala"" with the phrase hit-and-run in 2011, but none of those reports said Harris had been driving. Each mention was included in a news story about California crime statistics or multitopic stories that, in a separate section, identified Harris as California’s attorney general. No Google results for hit-and-run crashes near the intersection in June 2011. The woman in the video claimed that she decided to go public with her story after her mother died. But we found no recent obituaries naming an Alicia Brown or Alisha Brown as a surviving daughter. Video contains image of a 2018 Guam crash, other unrelated scenes The video includes generic images that are linked to other incidents or could have been pulled off the internet and used as generic stock photos. For example, about one minute into the full video , KBSF showed a picture of a car with a broken mirror and windshield. But that photo was from a 2018 crash in Guam involving a Toyota Yaris that struck a pedestrian, Pacific Daily News reported . (Screenshot from video on X) The video also showed two X-ray images about three minutes in. Using Bing reverse-image searches, we found that one, showing multiple rib fractures, was published in an October 2010 article in BMC Gastroenterology about Cronkhite-Canada syndrome causing rib fractures. The other shows a ""type C pelvic ring injury in a 12-year-old girl,"" according to a 2017 article in the Journal of Children’s Orthopaedics. No evidence that video is AI-generated, experts say Digital forensics experts told PolitiFact that based on their analysis, the clips of ""Alicia Brown"" don’t appear to be generated by artificial intelligence. ""I think most likely this is a good old fashioned (and not particularly well done or convincing) cheap fake where the interview is simply staged,"" said Hany Farid, University of California, Berkeley, professor specializing in digital forensics and misinformation. Siwei Lyu, a computer science and engineering professor at the University at Buffalo, performed an algorithmic and visual analysis of the video and ""cannot confirm the video itself was created with generative AI."" AI models have difficulty producing sighing and slurring sounds that he found in the audio. Features like inconsistent teeth in the mouth area, which are usually markers for AI-generated content, are also absent, he said. Meme accounts, paid X subscribers circulated false claim On X, the earliest mention of the claim that we found seemed to be a post from an X user named Liz Churchill. Churchill describes herself as a ""conspiracy theorist"" in her bio and is also a paid X subscriber, meaning her posts are promoted by the site’s algorithm. The original post is now unavailable, but a cached copy can be found here . The cached version’s time stamp is 3 p.m., but we found posts that reshared the now-deleted post before 11 a.m. ET. The X post linked to the KBSF-TV article and said, ""Kamala Harris was involved in a ‘hit and run’ accident in 2011 where she hit a 13-year old."" (Screenshot from X) Minutes later, a paid X account called ""miguelifornia"" shared the article link and a screenshot of the headline, then made another post including the video. The second post drew more than 700,000 views. In the next two hours, the video was shared by a paid X subscriber called ""I Meme Therefore I Am,"" gaining 11,000 reposts and more than 1.8 million views. After the Baltimore bridge collapse in March, that account spread an anti-Ukraine narrative .

The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. But the Eagles didn’t sponsor the poster. ""We are aware counterfeit political ads are being circulated and are working with our advertising partner to have them removed,"" the Eagles said Sept. 2 in an X statement. Eagles spokesperson Bob Lange told PolitiFact the team’s statement referred to the Harris bus stop ads. An unknown person or group of people illegally replaced paid advertisements in the bus shelters with unauthorized posters, Intersection, the company that owns the bus shelters where the ads were posted, said in an email to PolitiFact. ""We note that neither the Eagles nor Intersection had anything to do with the creation or posting of this unauthorized content,"" the company said, adding that seven of the ads have already been removed. Intersection is surveying other bus stops for other unauthorized posters. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to PolitiFact’s question about whether it authorized the posters. But a Harris spokesperson told NBC Philadelphia that it did not purchase the ads. It would be unusual for an NFL team to endorse a political candidate. We searched Google and the Nexis news database and found no instances of an NFL team doing so. We rate the claim that the Eagles endorsed Kamala Harris for president False. "
"September 4, 2024",JD Vance,"A zero-tolerance policy during the Trump administration ""led to less family separation than under Kamala Harris' border policies.”",false,"The Trump administration had a 2018 policy that led to the separation of more than 5,500 children from their parents by immigration officials at the border when they crossed into the U.S. illegally. The Biden-Harris administration rescinded that policy. The Trump campaign pointed to data about children who came to the U.S. alone without a parent or guardian. Those children were not separated from their parents by U.S. border officials.","Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, defended former President Donald Trump’s immigration record during an appearance on NBC and pointed instead at the Biden-Harris administration’s record. NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" host Kristen Welker asked Vance whether families would be separated under a mass deportation program if Trump were reelected. Vance said, ""You start with the most violent criminals in our country,"" and then claimed Harris' policies have led to thousands of migrant children living with sex traffickers and drug cartels instead of their families. ""There was a zero-tolerance policy during the Trump administration, and that led to less family separation than under Kamala Harris' border policies,"" Vance said Aug. 25 . ""That's what's so striking about this. Actually enforcing our border is the most humane thing, for children and certainly for American citizens."" ""Family separation"" and ""child separation"" are not legal terms. They have generally been used to refer to the Trump administration practice of having immigration officials systematically separate children from their parents at the U.S. border to deter illegal border crossings. When contacted for evidence to support Vance’s statement, the Trump campaign pointed us to data and information about children who crossed the border alone during the Biden-Harris administration. These examples are not equivalent. The Trump administration zero-tolerance policy meant that U.S. immigration officials separated children and parents who arrived at the border together. The children the Trump campaign is referring to did not come with parents or other relatives. Children separated from their parents are ""a completely different situation,"" said Peter Margulies, an immigration law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. Unaccompanied children have ""nothing to do with kids who arrive with their parents. It's like apples and oranges."" The Trump administration’s family separation policy Typically, a child and adult who arrive together at the U.S. border can be separated when: Border officials cannot establish the custodial relationship. Officials believe the custodian may threaten the child. The custodian is being detained for prosecution. Immigration experts told us in 2019 that family separations were rare during the Obama administration and preceding administrations and did not happen at the same scale as under the Trump administration. The controversial family separations during Trump’s tenure happened because of an April 2018 policy introduced by Trump’s then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Sessions said an ""escalated effort"" was necessary at the southwest border and directed the application of the ""zero-tolerance"" policy, to prosecute all adults illegally entering the United States. That meant that the Trump administration referred for prosecution all adult immigrants who illegally entered the country, even if they arrived with their children. When border officials referred parents for prosecution, their children were taken from them and placed in U.S. Health and Human Services Department custody. Amid growing criticism of family separations in public opinion surveys and by some Republicans , Trump issued a June 2018 executive order to detain families together when they arrived at the border if the parents faced prosecution. The executive order said the administration’s policy would be to ""maintain family unity."" The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration over the zero-tolerance policy. In December 2023, as part of a settlement, a federal judge prohibited the separation of families at the border for deterrence. Lee Gelernt, lead ACLU counsel, told PolitiFact that more than 5,500 children were separated from their parents at the border during the Trump administration. President Joe Biden rescinded the Trump era policy and issued a February 2021 executive order to establish a task force to reunite separated children and their families. The ACLU told us in August that up to 1,000 children have not yet been reunited with their parents. Unaccompanied children are not the same as children separated from parents To support Vance’s claim, the Trump campaign pointed us to monthly data about unaccompanied children border officials encountered during the Biden administration, including more than 6,000 encounters in July. The Trump campaign also pointed to an Aug. 19 Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General report about unaccompanied minors released from federal government custody. The report led Republican lawmakers and conservative news outlets to say that Immigration and Customs Enforcement "" lost "" the children or that they are "" missing ."" But the report does not mention children ""separated"" from their families at the border. The inspector general found that Immigration and Customs Enforcement transferred more than 448,000 unaccompanied children to Health and Human Services’ custody from fiscal years 2019 to 2023 (which includes about two years of Trump’s administration). The inspector general report said ICE reported there were more than 32,000 unaccompanied minors who did not appear for their immigration court hearings during this period and that children ""who do not appear for court are considered at higher risk for trafficking, exploitation, or forced labor."" But immigration experts told us that the Trump-Vance campaign is conflating unaccompanied minors with children separated at the border. The inspector general’s report ""is entirely about unaccompanied children, which by definition means they arrived at the border unaccompanied by a parent or other legal guardian,"" Theo Liebmann, a Hofstra University law professor who has represented immigrants, said. ""So it is not possible for the report to be speaking to any ‘separation’ of children from their parents by border personnel."" Trump policy was unusual Immigration experts said the Trump policy was one of a kind. ""To our rag, zero tolerance is the only policy that affirmatively resulted in the separation of children from their parents,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan organization focused on immigration. When parents in other countries send their children to cross the U.S. border alone, they are choosing to separate themselves in their home country. That’s different from family separation by U.S. border enforcement. ""The former is a problem of U.S. law generally, while the latter was a problem caused by Trump administration policies, such as prosecuting adult border crossers and placing their children with other adults,"" Margulies said. Policymakers from both political parties argue that federal laws that provide legal rights for unaccompanied children encourage parents to permit their children to travel alone to the U.S. Poverty, violence and climate change have led some children to leave their home countries in search of jobs in the U.S. ""But that's family separation ‘at the source,’ not at the border,"" Margulies said. Our ruling Vance said, ""There was a zero-tolerance policy during the Trump administration, and that led to less family separation than under Kamala Harris' border policies."" The terms ""family separation"" or ""child separation"" have generally described the Trump administration practice of having immigration officials separate children from their parents at the U.S. border to deter illegal crossings. Immigration experts said Trump’s policy was an outlier in recent decades among Republican and Democratic administrations. The policy caused the separation of 5,500 children from their parents at the U.S. border, according to the ACLU. The Trump-Vance campaign did not point to a Biden-Harris policy that lets border officials separate children from their families. The campaign referred us to data about children who arrived in the U.S. alone. But these examples are not equivalent. Unaccompanied children arrive at the border without a parent — a choice they or their families make before proceeding to the U.S. alone. We rate this statement False.

"September 4, 2024",Donald Trump,Vice President Kamala Harris “is a communist. … She is really a Marxist.”,pants-fire,"Marxism refers to the school of thought inspired by Karl Marx’s analysis of capitalism. Communism is a political system of government or a party that abolishes private property. Communism and Marxism experts said Vice President Kamala Harris’ positions do not align with those philosophies. Harris is not against private home or business ownership, for example. Her campaign pledge to pass a federal ban on price gouging on food drew criticism, but experts said it does not amount to communism.","Former President Donald Trump frequently derides Vice President Kamala Harris as ""Comrade Kamala."" He says she must be stopped to prevent the United States from turning communist or Marxist. ""She is a communist, I guess,"" Trump said in an Aug. 26 podcast with host Shawn Ryan , a former Navy SEAL who has praised Trump . ""I look at action, I don’t look at words,"" Trump said. ""She is really a Marxist. Her father is a Marxist professor. … This country is not ready for a Marxist or a communist."" Trump made similar statements in other speeches. In La Crosse, Wisconsin, he said, ""She is in fact a Marxist-slash-communist."" In Michigan, he said Harris ""is a Marxist, just like her father"" and also called her a ""fascist."" Ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Trump posted a fake image showing a red-clad female leader resembling Harris addressing a red-flag waving crowd while a communist hammer and sickle flag hung overhead. Weeks later, Elon Musk, the X owner and entrepreneur who backs Trump, posted another fake image of Harris wearing red communist military garb. These attacks echo those of 1950s McCarthyism, when Sen. Joe McCarthy, R-Wis., led hearings on what he alleged was communist infiltration in high levels of the federal government. Marxism refers to the school of thought inspired by Karl Marx’s analysis of capitalism. Communism is a political system of government or a party that abolishes private property. The attack line in 2024 could resonate with some Latino voters, including in Florida, whose families fled authoritarian regimes such as Cuba where the government seized their land and stifled dissent. We have rated similar attacks against congressional Democrats , Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla ., Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt ., and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio , as False or Pants on Fire. The case against Harris is similarly wrong. Her policies do not amount to communism or Marxism, political science experts said. ""Nearly all examples of communism in power came about through a violent revolution against the existing order and resulted in the abolition of private property, state takeover of the economy, one party, undemocratic rule, the crushing of dissent, and the loss of civil liberties and civil society institutions like a free press,"" Baruch College sociology and anthropology professor Ted Henken said. Trump campaign pointed to Harris position on price gouging Asked for evidence to support Trump’s claim that Harris is communist, the Trump campaign singled out her position on price controls. ""Kamala Harris has literally suggested price controls as a matter of economic policy,"" Trump campaign spokesperson Caroline Sunshine told PolitiFact. ""Would encourage you to inspect the well documented list of Marxist and communists who've suggested the same."" In an Aug. 16 speech in Raleigh, North Carolina , Harris said, ""I will work to pass the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food."" That would require buy-in from Congress. Harris called for ""new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules"" and said she favors more support for smaller food companies. But Harris has been vague about the details . In social posts and campaign website materials , Trump refers to Harris’ plan as ""Soviet-style price controls."" The Trump campaign pointed to a column written by Washington Post opinion writer Catherine Rampell, headlined: ""When your opponent calls you ‘communist,’ maybe don’t propose price controls?"" (Rampell has also criticized Trump’s economic ideas. ) We sent the Trump campaign’s evidence to academics with expertise in Marxism or communism, including those with expertise in Latin America or the former Soviet Union. We noted examples we found of Harris showing support for people owning their own homes or businesses — basically the opposite of calling for government takeovers. No expert called her a communist or Marxist. Harris supports conventional welfare state capitalism, in which the government regulates the market while respecting private property and economic rights, Henken said. ""Her positions on health care, the reigning in of price gouging, and assistance to home buyers and small businesses all presuppose the existence of a robust capitalist market-driven economy,"" Henken said. ""They only seek to make the availability of certain capitalist goods more fair and affordable. In a communist system, such goods would be controlled and provided by the government, not owned or controlled privately."" Jorge Duany, director of the Cuban Research Institute and anthropology professor at Florida International University, said ""a communist or Marxist person is someone who supports the state ownership of the means of production, usually controlled by a single political party."" But Harris hasn’t expressed such a position, Duany said. ""Nor has her political platform endorsed anything akin to the economic and political system in Cuba since 1959,"" he said. When we asked Harris’ campaign about Trump’s claims, spokesperson Ammar Moussa said, ""She is a capitalist."" Harris’ interest in tackling price gouging, which her critics see as interfering in the free market, has precedent — but mostly among Republicans. President Richard Nixon announced in 1971 ""a freeze on all prices and wages throughout the United States."" When Harris was a senator from California running in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, she took some stances favored by the left wing of her party. Harris then backed the Green New Deal , a blueprint for environmental policy changes, and Medicare for All , which would have established a national health insurance program administered by the federal government (private insurers could continue to operate, but only to offer supplemental coverage). She has pursued neither policy as vice president and has not touted them on the 2024 campaign trail — and even if she had, that doesn’t mean she is a communist. ""The positions she has taken on some issues are left-wing, but hardly communist,"" said Harvey Klehr, retired Emory University historian who has written books about communism. Anna Grzymala-Busse, a Stanford University political science professor and expert on post-communist politics, told us by email that Harris’ positions don’t make her a communist or Marxist. ""Both of the mainstream American political parties are to the right of the most conservative mainstream parties in Europe, where *right-wing* parties support national health care systems, subsidized university educations, public housing, and far greater taxation,"" Grzymala-Busse said. Communist regimes had planned economies in which all prices and quantities were set by the government. ""Price controls may be misguided, but they are *not* communist,"" Grzymala-Busse said. ""Price controls can distort free markets: Communism does away with them. There is simply no comparison."" Harris’ father was described as a Marxist professor Harris’ father, Donald Harris, is a retired Stanford University economics professor . In a July 25 profile , The Economist magazine said Donald Harris’ work ""is more unashamedly Marxist than anything in modern American politics."" The magazine said his 1978 book, ""Capital Accumulation and Income Distribution,"" focused on economic inequality, growth and the downside of profit-seeking capitalist economies. Some other news outlets, including Fox News , said the Stanford Daily newspaper in 1974 called Harris a ""Marxist."" (The New Yorker magazine wrote that Donald Harris is estranged from his daughter.) We contacted the elder Harris at his Stanford email address and received no reply. But even if calling him a Marxist were reasonable, it does not mean that his daughter holds identical views. Our ruling Trump said Harris ""is a communist. … She is really a Marxist."" Four experts we interviewed answered unanimously: She is neither. The Trump campaign pointed to Harris’ plan to ban price gouging by implementing price controls. That proposal — which is short on details — has been criticized as ill-advised, including by some liberals. But its scope falls far short of communist policy, which advocates a political system of government or a party that abolishes private property. Harris has not called for seizing private homes or businesses. Harris’ campaign describes Harris’ stance as capitalist, not Marxist, and experts say her policies are based on the assumption of a market-driven economy. Her issue portfolio consists of mainstream left-of-center views, and would be uncontroversial even among right-of-center parties in Europe. When Trump calls Harris a communist, it evokes fear in Americans who fled authoritarian communist regimes. Neither her past nor current positions reveal Harris, the U.S. vice president for the last four years, to be communist. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. We also saw a Facebook post that said the bill would ""ban voter ID statewide."" These claims are misleading and lack context about California’s current voter ID laws. Senate Bill 1174 prohibits local governments from requiring voter ID at polling places, but existing state law already says that, in most cases , California voters needn’t show ID before voting at the polls. The Legislature passed the bill in August, and it awaits Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approval. The bill was drafted in response to Huntington Beach, California , passing a measure that would supersede California state law and require voters to present their ID at the city’s polls. By state law, however, California voters need to show ID to polling place workers only if they are voting for the first time after registering to vote by mail and did not provide a valid form of ID on their registration form, a California secretary of state spokesperson said in an email. S.B. 1174 would block Huntington Beach’s voter ID requirement, which is to take effect in 2026. ""If enacted into law, SB 1774 will reduce potential voter confusion that could result from having local election procedures in place that conflict with state law,"" said Kim Alexander, president of the voting rights nonprofit California Voter Foundation. Voter ID is hotly debated in U.S. politics. Opponents say tighter laws make voting less accessible, especially for minorities, young people, low-income voters and people with disabilities. Proponents of tighter rules say requiring voter ID can prevent fraud. Only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections; Congress banned noncitizen voting in 1996. Noncitizens rarely cast ballots. Those who do face stiff penalties including deportation. In April, California officials sued Huntington Beach, saying its new voter ID policy conflicts with state law and would create barriers for low-income, nonwhite, young, elderly and disabled voters. State Sen. Dave Min, D-Calif., who authored S.B. 1774, said April 2 that California ""already has robust identification procedures to register to vote."" All people who register to vote in California must sign a notice, under penalty of perjury, that states they are U.S. citizens, a California secretary of state spokesperson said. Voter registrations are then verified with the Department of Motor Vehicles’ driver's license databases and Social Security Administration information. Applicants whose information is not verified must show their IDs at the polls the first time they vote. Providing false voter information is a felony punishable by up to three years in prison. Voter fraud does occur in California elections, but is rare. For example, there were eight documented cases of voter fraud in California in the 2020 election, according to data from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

Most Americans would not be subject to such a tax. There are fewer than 10,000 people in the U.S. with a net worth of at least $100 million.","Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign recently said she supports a proposed policy aimed at the ultrawealthy that President Joe Biden has pushed for years: a new tax on unrealized capital gains, or unsold assets that have increased in value. But some social media users exaggerated how such a tax would affect the majority of Americans. An Aug. 25 Facebook post read, ""Home Owner Do you Realize that Harris plan to tax unrecognized Capital Gains mean(s) if your house goes up in value you will have to pay that Tax Even if you don’t sell your House!""

They were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Harris’ opponent, former President Donald Trump, said at an Aug. 23 campaign rally in Las Vegas that this unrealized capital gains tax ""will soon be applied to small business owners and you will be forced to sell your restaurant immediately."" Harris’ official campaign account, Kamala HQ, responded on X that the tax would apply only to people with $100 million in wealth. How would Harris’ plan to tax unrealized capital gains work? Harris has not released any tax policies. Harris’ campaign said she supports tax provisions in Biden’s 2025 budget proposal, including a tax on unrealized capital gains, Axios , The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported. When PolitiFact contacted the Harris campaign for more information about Harris’ tax plan, the campaign declined to comment, pointing instead to reporting from Axios and Minneapolis-based news outlet KMSP-TV . Biden’s budget proposes tax hikes for the wealthiest Americans; it would not raise taxes for people earning less than $400,000 a year. One of Biden’s proposals is a 25% minimum tax on income, including unrealized capital gains, for taxpayers with a net worth — meaning assets minus liabilities — of more than $100 million. If instituted, the White House said , this so-called billionaires tax would apply only to the wealthiest 0.01% of Americans — not the vast majority of the country’s taxpayers. In the U.S., there are about 9,850 centimillionaires, or people with at least $100 million in wealth, according to a March 2024 report from Henley & Partners, a wealth and migration advisory firm, and New World Wealth, a global wealth research firm. So, of this small ultrawealthy group, only the people who have more than 20% of their wealth in tradable assets — for example, publicly traded stock — would pay taxes on unrealized capital gains, Biden’s budget proposal states. Taxpayers with more than 80% of their wealth in nontradable assets, such as real estate and shares in private startups, would be considered ""illiquid."" These taxpayers could choose to include only unrealized gain in tradable assets when determining how much they owe in taxes, according to the budget proposal. Currently, capital gains are taxed only after a realized event, such as when someone sells an asset. If an asset remains unrealized — never sold — it’s not subject to taxes. Some economists said an unrealized capital gains tax would promote more equity in the tax code. ""As it is now, normal workers are taxed on their entire income, but we have a situation where the very rich can have hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars of capital gains which go altogether untaxed,"" said Dean Baker, co-founder and senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Wealthy people can hold stocks until they die, and then pass the assets to their heirs without paying taxes as long as their gains are unrealized, Baker said. Biden’s budget proposal argues that tax-free accumulation of wealth over generations exacerbates income-and-wealth disparities in the U.S. Adam Michel, tax policy studies director at the libertarian Cato Institute, said an unrealized capital gains tax would overly burden the Internal Revenue Service and would discourage investment in burgeoning businesses. ""Such a system would encourage investors to put their money in safer investments, such as government bonds, rather than new innovative industries, like new energy sources, biopharmaceuticals, or AI,"" Michel said. Economic experts told PolitiFact that this proposed tax change is not certain, even if Harris wins the presidency. Any changes would require congressional approval, and control of the House and Senate will also be decided in November. It’s also unclear whether a wealth tax, such as this one, would survive legal challenges . Our ruling Social media posts claimed Harris’ ""plan to tax unrecognized Capital Gains mean(s) if your house goes up in value you will have to pay that Tax Even if you don’t sell your House."" That claim ignores several critical facts about Harris’ plan, which is derived from Biden’s 2025 budget proposal. Most crucially: Most Americans wouldn’t have to pay a tax on the appreciated value of their unsold assets and this tax would apply only to people with more than $100 million in wealth.

"August 30, 2024",Elizabeth Warren,"“JD Vance actually sent a letter last year to the Department of Justice saying, ‘enforce the Comstock Act.’”",true,"Former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, joined about 40 other Republicans in 2023 to send the U.S. Justice Department a letter urging it to enforce the Comstock Act to crack down on abortion pills. The 1873 law bars the mailing of ""obscene"" materials used in abortions. Republicans have tried to revive it to limit or ban mailing abortion pills. The Republicans’ letter challenged the department’s interpretation of the law and demanded that it shut down all mailing of abortion medication.","U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she isn’t buying the Republican presidential ticket’s position on abortion. NBC ""Meet the Press"" host Kristen Welker asked Warren on Aug. 25 what she thought of former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, saying in an earlier interview that Trump wouldn’t sign a federal abortion ban . Warren said, ""American women are not stupid,"" and that the candidates have an anti-abortion track record. ""JD Vance actually sent a letter last year to the Department of Justice saying, ‘enforce the Comstock Act,’"" Warren said. ""And remember, he did that, and then Donald Trump picked him to be his vice president."" The Comstock Act is an 1873 antivice law that bans the mailing of ""obscene"" materials used in abortions. Anti-abortion advocates have tried to resurrect the law to prohibit sending materials such as abortion-inducing medication and surgical equipment. In January 2023, Vance joined about 40 congressional Republicans in sending a letter urging the U.S. Justice Department to enforce the Comstock Act to crack down on mailing abortion pills, which are used in the majority of U.S. abortions . The letter Vance signed was in response to the release of a Justice Department memo saying U.S. law doesn’t prohibit the mailing of abortion medication as long as the sender doesn’t intend for the medication to be used illegally. ""Because there are manifold ways in which recipients in every state may lawfully use such drugs, including to produce an abortion, the mere mailing of such drugs to a particular jurisdiction is an insufficient basis for concluding that the sender intends them to be used unlawfully,"" Christopher Schroeder, assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, wrote in the Dec. 23, 2022, memo. The Justice Department was studying the question after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022 and the U.S. Postal Service asked the department to address whether the Comstock Act criminalizes the mailing of mifepristone, the first pill in a two-drug regimen for a medication abortion. But Vance and other Republicans said the Justice Department’s interpretation departed from the law’s plain-text meaning. ""We demand that you act swiftly and in accordance with the law, shut down all mail-order abortion operations,"" Vance and fellow Republican lawmakers wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland. Signatories included current House Speaker Mike Johnson from Louisiana, Florida Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The Republicans cited other federal criminal conspiracy and money laundering laws and asked the department to rescind or redraft the memo. They said department officials should hold accountable physicians, pharmacists and others ""who break the Federal mail-order abortion laws"" and demanded it cease its efforts to ""prevent States from regulating or prohibiting abortion drugs."" On July 7 , Vance told NBC he supported access to abortion medication, citing a June Supreme Court ruling that left mifepristone on the market. But the court rejected a legal challenge of the pill’s FDA approval on procedural grounds, not on the case’s merits. Thus, the court could face the question again. Since becoming the Republican vice presidential nominee, Vance hasn’t weighed in specifically on the Comstock Act. PolitiFact contacted the Trump campaign but did not hear back. Our ruling Warren said Vance sent a letter to the Justice Department asking it to enforce the Comstock Act. Vance in 2023 signed onto a letter to the department with about 40 other Republicans. The letter challenged the department’s interpretation of the law and demanded that it shut down all mailing of abortion pills. Since becoming the Republican vice presidential candidate, Vance has said he supports a Supreme Court decision that left abortion medication on the market. Warren’s statement is accurate.

"August 29, 2024",Rick Scott,"“This month alone, more than 16,000 non-citizens have been removed from the voter rolls in 3 states.”",half-true,"Three Republican-led states — Alabama, Texas and Virginia — have taken steps to remove or flag ineligible people on the voter rolls, since at least 2021. This included noncitizens, or potential noncitizens, according to state officials. There are some unknowns about the people affected, and the number of people who turn out to be noncitizens could change. Congress banned noncitizen voting in federal elections in 1996. Noncitizens rarely cast ballots. If they do, they face stiff penalties including jail time, deportation or denial of citizenship applications.","Republican politicians from multiple states say noncitizen voting is rampant and they are doing whatever they can to stop it. U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., wants lawmakers to vote on a federal bill that aims to prevent noncitizen voting. Congress blocked noncitizens from voting in federal elections in 1996. ""Illegals SHOULD NOT BE VOTING in American elections,"" Scott wrote Aug. 28 on X, linking to a clip of an interview with Newsmax. ""This month alone, more than 16,000 non-citizens have been removed from the voter rolls in 3 states. It’s a serious problem — and as the next Senate GOP Leader I’ll make sure we fix it."" Scott, who is running for reelection this year, wants to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as the Senate Republican leader. Despite evidence that noncitizen voting is rare, Republicans and social media influencers are making it a cornerstone of their election-year messaging. Scott’s Senate office confirmed that he was referring to voters in Texas, Virginia and Alabama. We found that Scott’s number has some merit, but he misconstrued some of the details: Scott said the removals happened in August. Republican state officials in these states announced their actions only this month. Texas and Virginia officials said they had been removed during the past few years. Scott used the word ""removed."" Texas and Virginia officials said they removed the voters. But Alabama moved them from active to inactive status. Alabama’s secretary of state said some of the people might have since become naturalized citizens and are therefore eligible to vote if they update their information. Texas called the voters ""potential noncitizens."" It’s unclear how many of the 16,000 people voted in an election The voters flagged for citizenship questions add up to less than 1% of those states’ voter rolls. Texas, Virginia and Alabama state officials have been looking for noncitizens on voter rolls Here is what we know about the efforts to remove noncitizen voters in three states: Texas : Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said Aug. 26 that the state removed about 1 million ineligible people from the voter rolls since 2021. Most of them were removed because they had died or moved or didn’t respond to notices sent by election officials. Additionally, Abbott wrote, ""of the over 6,500 potential noncitizens removed from the voter rolls, approximately 1,930 have a voter history."" Those 1,930 were sent to the state attorney general for potential legal action. The word ""potential"" raises the question about whether they were proved to be noncitizens. The Dallas Morning News , a PolitiFact Texas partner, reported that those 6,500 people were sent a notice that their voter registration was under examination but did not respond. The notice states that they had 30 days to provide information or documentation establishing their qualifications for voter registration. A previous effort to clean up Texas’ voter rolls went poorly in 2019 when the state started with an error-filled list of 95,000 potential noncitizens on the voter rolls. The effort led to lawsuits and the secretary of state’s resignation. This time, Texas’ list is much smaller. Alabama : Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen said in an Aug. 13 statement that his office identified ""3,251 individuals who are registered to vote in Alabama who have been issued noncitizen identification numbers by the Department of Homeland Security."" Allen did not say how many voted. Allen instructed county boards of registrars to change the status for those voters to inactive and begin removing noncitizens from the rolls. Allen sent the list to the state’s attorney general for potential prosecution. Allen said it’s possible that some of the people have since become naturalized citizens and are therefore eligible to vote; but they have to update their information. Barry Stephenson, chairman of Jefferson County’s Board of Registrars, told PolitiFact his county had 557 voters on that list. ""They are not being removed — they are moving from active status to inactive,"" Stephenson said. As long as they fill out the form attesting to their citizenship, they can vote. Stephenson told PolitiFact that a couple of people who received a notice called the office and said that they had green cards and didn’t know they were registered to vote. They said they never asked to register to vote while getting a driver’s license. Jefferson County has 47,000 people on the inactive list, so the names the state flagged for citizenship are a small slice. Virginia : Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in an Aug. 7 executive order that the state removed 6,303 noncitizens from voter rolls from January 2022 to July 2024. Youngkin’s order did not say whether any people cast ballots. Virginia used state Department of Motor Vehicles records and federal Department of Homeland Security data to identify noncitizens. Youngkin’s order stated that they may have ""purposefully or accidentally registered to vote."" Voting by noncitizens is rare Elections experts say it is possible for an ineligible voter to accidentally register to vote at the DMV, which could be a mistake by the applicant or the clerk. And it’s possible DMV records on citizenship are outdated. ""All they know is what your citizenship status was whenever you interacted with the DMV,"" said Jonathan Diaz, an election law expert at the Campaign Legal Center, which promotes voting access. (The center has sent letters to Alabama and Texas officials challenging their recent actions.) Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of Common Cause Texas, agreed with Diaz: ""The fact that a voter was, at some point, not a citizen, certainly does not mean they voted during the time they were not a citizen."" In 1996, Congress banned noncitizen voting in federal elections as part of a broader toughening of penalties on people in the country illegally. ""Noncitizens"" includes people legally and illegally in the U.S. Safeguards already exist to prevent noncitizen voting. When people register to vote, they attest that they are citizens. Think tanks, academics , courts and journalists have analyzed claims about noncitizen voting at least since 2016 and have found only sporadic cases that wouldn’t swing federal elections. Penalties for noncitizen voting can include jail time, deportation or denial of citizenship applications. One of the largest examples we could find of noncitizens charged for voting stems from North Carolina. In 2020, federal prosecutors charged 19 people in North Carolina with voter fraud after they cast ballots mostly in the 2016 election. Sixteen people pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors related to voting as a noncitizen. Three cases were dismissed. More than 4.5 million people in North Carolina voted in the 2016 presidential election. State election officials routinely take steps to remove ineligible people from the voter rolls in accordance with federal law. It could take several months or longer for authorities to determine whether any of the people the three states found on the voter rolls will face criminal charges. Additional information about these efforts could come out in potential lawsuits, meaning it could be years before some unknowns about the current removals are answered. Our ruling Scott said, ""This month alone, more than 16,000 non-citizens have been removed from the voter rolls in 3 states."" Scott is talking about something that did happen, but there is a lot we don’t know about the 16,000 total from available information. The outcome of investigations and potential lawsuits could take months or years. Based on what we know, Scott’s timeframe is off. Not all of these voters were taken off the rolls in August. State officials announced actions related to these voters in August. Texas announced it had removed 6,500 ""potential noncitizens"" since 2021. The word ""potential"" leaves some wiggle room. Virginia said it had ""removed"" 6,303 voters since 2022. The names in Alabama — 3,251 — were moved from active to inactive status, but that’s not the same as being removed. They can still vote as long as they sign a form attesting that they are U.S. citizens. Being on the voter rolls and casting a ballot are not the same thing. We don’t know how many of the potential noncitizen voters cast ballots; Texas said 1,930 had a Texas voter history. When we add up the numbers on the lists in the three states, it amounts to less than 1% of registered voters. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

"August 29, 2024",JD Vance,"“Anything that you lose on the tariff from the perspective of the consumer, you gain in higher wages, so you're ultimately much better off.”",false,Surveys have shown that the vast majority of economists believe tariffs’ negative impacts — which include higher costs for consumers — consistently outweigh the benefits. Academic and think tank studies bolster those views.,"With former President Donald Trump proposing aggressive tariffs on foreign goods — including a 10% tariff on all nondomestic goods sold in the U.S. — his 2024 presidential running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, defended their benefits on NBC’s ""Meet the Press."" ""I think economists really disagree about the effects of tariffs,"" Vance told host Kristen Welker Aug. 25 . He said some economists say tariffs raise costs for consumers. ""But what other people say, and I think the record supports this other view, is that it causes this dynamic effect where more jobs come into the country. Anything that you lose on the tariff from the perspective of the consumer, you gain in higher wages, so you're ultimately much better off."" When contacted for comment, a Republican National Committee spokesperson cited a study by Coalition for a Prosperous America , a group of manufacturers and labor unions that generally supports higher tariffs. The study says a 10% tariff ""would stimulate domestic production and raise economic growth to produce a 5.7% increase in real income for the average American household."" Most economists disagree with this idea. Our previous review of academic studies of real-world tariffs concluded that consumers ultimately shoulder most of the burden in higher prices for goods, and the burden outweighs tariffs’ economic benefits. ""In any profession that includes more than 20,000 members, there will be disagreement, and I’m sure Sen. Vance can recruit some adherents to his views,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a think tank. But, Burtless said, ""the great majority of economists favor freer trade policies,"" which means fewer tariffs. What happens when tariffs are levied? The idea behind imposing tariffs is to make American companies more competitive with their foreign counterparts, by increasing prices on imported goods and therefore making domestic goods more attractive to consumers. As American companies prosper, the thinking goes, they can hire more workers and increase employees’ pay. Those workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, spreading those dollars around the economy more broadly. Economists have told us, however, that real-world examples of tariffs working as intended are rare. Consumers in the tariff-levying country are on the losing end of the deals, by having to pay higher prices, they said. When the tariff levied is small, an importer may choose to keep its prices stable rather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But that is not a certainty. ""Tariffs artificially raise the cost of doing business, which depresses overall economic production in the form of lower gross domestic product, artificially higher prices, and fewer goods sold,"" Boise State University political scientist Ross Burkhart, who studies trade policy, told PolitiFact. ""For the consumer, this means a reduction in purchasing power."" Tariffs also mean that producers pay more as prices rise for materials used to make products domestically. ""There are far more jobs in industries that use steel as an input than there are steelmaker jobs,"" Daniel Mitchell, an independent libertarian economist, told PolitiFact. And higher input costs are also likely to be passed on to consumers, economists said. Meanwhile, U.S. producers can expect to face retaliatory tariffs, which can also raise prices for U.S. consumers. And a decline in international competition hurts consumers by enabling the remaining producers to raise prices. There is also evidence that because lower-income Americans tend to spend a larger portion of their income on goods, they feel the pinch from tariffs more so than affluent Americans. ""Economists will disagree about the exact amount of harm this inflicts on consumers and the U.S. economy more generally,"" Burtless said. ""But most of us probably agree there will be at least some reduction in our standard of living, at least eventually."" Are consumers ""much better off"" after tariffs, as Vance said? Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right group, called tariffs an ""unambiguous negative for consumers,"" and said ""there is vast empirical literature to buttress this conclusion."" Studies of past tariff impacts on consumers, jobs and wages include: The Tax Foundation , a center-right group, found in a 2024 study that tariffs on thousands of products — enacted under Trump and continued under President Joe Biden — reduced employment by 142,000 full-time equivalent jobs, while also shaving 0.2% off gross domestic product. (GDP is the market value of all the goods and services a country produces.) A 2024 paper published by researchers from Cornell, Yale, Duke and New York universities found that tariffs on imported solar panels were depressing employment and wages. Lifting the tariffs, the authors concluded, would have increased domestic employment and wages on net. A 2020 UCLA study calculated consumer losses of $51 billion from Trump tariffs through 2019, which was greater than gains to producers and the federal Treasury from tariff payments. A 2019 study for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the costs of Trump’s tariff fell entirely on domestic consumers, with a $1.4 billion-per-month reduction in U.S. inflation-adjusted income by the end of 2018. ""Tariffs generally hurt consumers by raising prices and distorting the market,"" Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist said. ""They may help specific areas and industries, and they may look like a small per-person cost, but they're generally very high cost on a per-job saved or created basis."" Sinclair and other economists acknowledged that tariffs can make sense in limited cases, such as for national security reasons. There’s also a case to be made for protecting domestic producers that face sudden overseas competition, said Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. But even in those scenarios, it requires ""carefully thinking through which sectors are being protected, rather than blanket protection,"" Baker said. Do economists ""disagree about the effects of tariffs,"" as Vance said? There is little disagreement on this question among credentialed economists, according to surveys. In 1990, 2000, 2011 and 2021, researchers surveyed members of the American Economic Association, a professional group for economists, to gauge consensus among the group’s members on a range of economic propositions. One proposition asked whether ""tariffs and import quotas usually reduce general economic welfare."" In each of the surveys spanning three decades, 94% to 95% of economists surveyed agreed that tariffs reduced general economic welfare. Our ruling Vance said, ""Anything that you lose on the tariff from the perspective of the consumer, you gain in higher wages, so you're ultimately much better off."" The majority of economists believe the negative impacts from tariffs, including higher costs, consistently outweigh the benefits for consumers. Academic and think tank studies on tariffs’ effects bolster the economists’ views. We rate the statement False. "

"August 28, 2024",X posts,The order of candidate names on North Carolina’s ballot shows a “clear attempt at voter manipulation.”,false,Vice President Kamala Harris’ and other presidential candidates’ names appear above Donald Trump’s on North Carolina’s ballot. The order of names is chosen at random before every election. Trump’s name appeared first on the ballot in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.,"A social media post claims that North Carolina’s ballot for the November election has been ""manipulated"" to hurt former President Donald Trump. ""Reports show Trump is poised to appear near the bottom of the ballot in North Carolina,"" the Aug. 27 post says on X, formerly Twitter. ""This is indefensible and a clear attempt at voter manipulation."" A day after the claim was posted, it had been viewed nearly 1 million times. Pundits and political strategists pay attention to the order of names on a ballot because candidates whose names are listed first tend to perform better than candidates whose names are listed further down the ballot, researchers have found . The names of some of Trump’s presidential election opponents do appear higher than Trump’s on the North Carolina ballot. But there’s no evidence that the ballot was manipulated. North Carolina state law requires the order of candidates’ names to be determined by a drawing, and election officials have used the same process for many years. For this year’s election, the state board conducted the drawing Dec. 15. First, election officials place 26 balls, each labeled with a letter of the alphabet, in a bingo wheel.An election official spins the wheel until a ball comes out. This year, the ball showed the letter D. Then, election officials flip a coin to see whether candidates will be listed in alphabetical order (heads) or reverse alphabetical order (tails). This year, the coin showed heads, meaning the candidates would appear on ballots in alphabetical order, starting with the letter D. The candidates are sorted by last name. That’s how the state elections board determined that the candidates would appear in the following order: D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, A, B, C. As a result, the names of five presidential candidates — Kamala Harris, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Chase Oliver, Jill Stein, and Randall Terry — appear above Trump’s name on the ballot. Kennedy recently suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump. However, his name remains on the ballot because the We The People party — which nominated Kennedy — has not asked the state elections board to remove his name from the ballot. If President Joe Biden hadn’t dropped out of the race, his name would have appeared on the ballot last. Trump had better luck in previous drawings, appearing first on the ballot in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. In 2020 , candidates’ names appeared alphabetically starting with the letter O. In 2016 , candidates’ names appeared alphabetically starting with the letter H. PolitiFact NC contacted the X user who claimed this year’s ballot was manipulated, but the user didn’t respond. Our ruling The post said the order of names listed on North Carolina’s ballot shows a ""clear attempt at voter manipulation."" There’s no evidence North Carolina’s election ballot has been manipulated. We rate this claim False. "

"August 28, 2024",Donald Trump,"“Kamala cast the tiebreaking vote to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to go after your tip income.”",false,"Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate in 2022 to pass the Inflation Reduction Act. That bill gave an additional $80 billion to the Internal Revenue Service. A 2021 Treasury Department report said that the IRS would use money to hire about 87,000 new workers over a decade. But they were not all for enforcement. And it did not plan to increase audits for households earning less than $400,000. In 2023, the IRS proposed a new tip reporting program for service industry employers to report tips voluntarily to aid tax compliance. It was structured to replace preexisting programs but was never adopted.","Former President Donald Trump called Vice President Kamala Harris a ""copycat"" for showing support for a no-tax-on-tips plan. Trump said Harris’ stance conflicts with her voting record. Trump campaigned on eliminating tip taxes June 9 during a rally in Las Vegas . On Aug. 11 , Harris also endorsed the concept at a Las Vegas. With more than 22% of Nevada’s workforce employed by the service and hospitality industry, the issue of taxes on tips is of high interest in this battleground state . On Aug. 23 at a Las Vegas restaurant, Trump said: ""Kamala cast the tiebreaking vote to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to go after your tip income."" Two days later, Trump unveiled an ad that said, ""Harris and Biden have literally unleashed the IRS to harass workers who receive tips."" The ad shows a fearful homeowner as workers in suits arrive to comb through her house. In August, we debunked a similar viral statement on Instagram about Harris and tipped income. Harris cast the tiebreaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, but the law did not lay out a plan to send 87,000 agents after tipped workers. And a 2023 IRS proposal to replace programs for taxed tip compliance was never implemented. IRS planned to hire more workers, but not all in enforcement The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act increased taxes on large corporations and gave an additional $80 billion to the Internal Revenue Service. The claim that the IRS would hire 87,000 IRS agents came from a 2021 Department of Treasury report that said the IRS would use the $80 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act to hire 86,852 full-time employees by 2031. But not all those jobs are for enforcement. In 2023, the IRS used money from the Inflation Reduction Act to pay for 13,661 positions, including 495 for enforcement. From 2024 to 2030, the agency expects to hire about 32,500 more for enforcement. In total, for all jobs including enforcement, operations and taxpayer services, the IRS plans to hire about 53,000 employees from 2023 to 2030. The agency has said it focuses enforcement against large corporations and wealthy taxpayers. The IRS said it had collected more than $1 billion from high-wealth taxpayers with past-due taxes since the law’s passage. The Treasury Department previously said audits will not increase for households earning less than the $400,000 threshold. The median wage for waiters and waitresses is about $31,940, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — far below that threshold. The Trump campaign pointed to a March 2022 CBS report that low-income households with less than $25,000 in annual earnings are more than five times as likely to be audited by the IRS as everyone else. The data came from an analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University that preceded President Joe Biden’s signing of the Inflation Reduction Act into law. Susan Long, TRAC’s co-director and a professor of managerial statistics at Syracuse University, told us that the higher audit rates were driven by the ""IRS targeting low income families claiming an earned income credit — not anything directly related to tip income per se."" IRS proposed a new tip reporting program to replace existing programs In February 2023, the IRS proposed a new tip reporting program that would let service industry employers report tips voluntarily to help with tax compliance. The Service Industry Tip Compliance Agreement program aimed to use advancements in point-of-sale, time and attendance systems, and electronic payment settlement methods to improve tip reporting compliance. The proposal was intended to replace three tip compliance agreements that have existed since 1993 . The agency never adopted it. ""Treasury and the IRS have no plans to move forward with the voluntary program and, as such, there are no new reporting or compliance components,"" Treasury spokesperson Ashley Schapitl said. ""We continue to carefully consider comments received in response to the proposed guidance."" Erica York, a senior economist and research director with Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy, said the Inflation Reduction Act did not change the tax treatment of tips. ""Tips have been reportable as income for decades and decades,"" York said in an email. She pointed to a form from 1966 that reminded taxpayers to include tips when reporting their income. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 ""introduced more stringent rules for tip reporting in an effort to crack down on underreporting,"" York said. (But York added that that law wasn’t the start of taxing tips.) The IRS established agreements in the late 1990s and early 2000s for industries such as restaurants and casinos to enhance tax compliance among tipped employees and their employers through taxpayer education, instead of auditing. ​​A 2018 Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration study found that of the employers with tip reporting agreements that filed 2016 tax year forms, 30% had projected unreported tips totaling close to $1.66 billion. The Trump campaign pointed to news articles and the Americans for Tax Reform report that took a dim view of the tips compliance proposal. But York also told us, ""The new program wouldn’t change what tipped workers owe on their income."" ""My understanding is that the proposed program has been in development for a number of years, potentially dating back to this 2013 proposal from the IRS ."" Our ruling Trump said Harris ""cast the tiebreaking vote to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to go after your tip income."" But his statement conflates and distorts two different policy proposals — one of which did not become reality — and misleadingly characterizes Harris’ position. In 2022, Harris cast a tiebreaking vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $80 billion for the IRS. Although the Treasury Department had previously said the money would be used to hire about 87,000 workers, that was not all for enforcement. And the law didn’t state the IRS would pursue tipped workers. The agency is hiring enforcement workers, but fewer than Trump said. In 2023, there were 13,661 IRS workers who were funded through the Inflation Reduction Act including 495 for enforcement. From 2023 to 2030, the agency plans to hire about 32,500 for enforcement through the act. In 2023, the IRS proposed a new program for service industry employers to report tips voluntarily to aid tax compliance. But the IRS has no plans to proceed with that proposal. We rate his statement False. RELATED : No, Jacky Rosen didn’t say ending taxes on tips would hurt Nevada families "

"August 26, 2024",Bryan Steil,"Says U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin ""believes taxpayer dollars should be used for abortion.""",half-true,"U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis.’ office pointed to U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., voting against various amendments regarding abortion and introducing the Reproductive Health Travel Fund Act of 2023, which would provide grants to organizations that transport pregnant women to receive an abortion. The proposed legislation would also provide funding for childcare, meals, lost wages and doula care. But it specifically states funding cannot be used for an abortion procedure.","Long before Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race was set in the August primary, voters had been hearing about the top two candidates and their stance on issues like abortion. U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., called out U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., on abortion in an interview on UpFront on WISN-TV in April. When asked about Donald Trump’s position on abortion, Steil said: ""At the national level what we’re often talking about is whether taxpayer dollars should be used. You have someone like Tammy Baldwin that believes taxpayer dollars should be used for abortion. And somebody like me that comes down on the side of life."" To be clear, Baldwin is running against Republican Eric Hovde, a madison businessman, not Steil, who is in his own race against Democrat Peter Barca. But is Steil right that Baldwin supports using taxpayer money for abortions? Baldwin votes related to abortion When we asked Steil’s office for evidence, his staff noted that Baldwin voted against the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act in January 2019. Baldwin’s vote contributed to the measure failing in the Senate. A January 2019 story from Politico called the vote on the legislation ""a largely symbolic effort timed to coincide with the country’s largest annual anti-abortion demonstration in Washington."" Asked if Baldwin supported tax dollars paying for abortions, Baldwin campaign spokesman Andrew Mamo did not answer the question directly, stating only Baldwin ""will always vote to support womens’ freedom to make their own health care decisions."" Meanwhile, Steil’s office also pointed us to two amendments in 2021 proposed by U.S. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., related to the potential use of taxpayer dollars for abortions that Baldwin voted against. But in the way Washington operates, there can be many reasons for a no vote – from opposition to cost to other items in the measure, or as a response to political maneuvering. Baldwin introduces bill on ‘reproductive health travel’ Finally, Steil’s office also pointed to Baldwin introducing a bill in the Senate dubbed the Reproductive Health Travel Fund Act of 2023. According to the text of the bill, the measure would ""authorize grants to eligible entities to pay for travel-related expenses and logistical support for individuals seeking abortion services, and for other purposes."" The proposed legislation offers funding for organizations that work with pregnant women on things such as travel, meals, logistics, childcare, patient education and even doula care. It’s clear by its own description that taxpayer funds could be used to help people who are trying to get an abortion. However, the bill also states that ""an eligible entity receiving a grant under this section shall not use the grant for costs of an abortion procedure."" So, it’s far from as clear cut as Steil tried to make it. Our ruling Steil claimed Baldwin ""believes taxpayer dollars should be used for abortion."" His office pointed to several bills and amendments related to abortion as evidence, but none are directly on point. The central piece of evidence he cited is a bill Baldwin introduced that would provide funding for travel costs and other aspects of reproductive healthcare, including access to abortion —but the same bill specifically states the federal funding cannot be used for an abortion procedure. Baldwin, meanwhile, does not help her own case, in that a spokesperson did not directly answer if the senator was in favor of taxpayer funds paying for abortions. Our definition of Half True is ""the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here. "

Now, with the Democratic National Convention in full swing, some social media users are again making baseless claims about piles of bricks, assertions that began more than four years ago. In mid-August, multiple X users reposted videos of a person discovering pallets of bricks outside of a hospital and asking about their purpose.

She remained seated when the crowd cheered for her during remarks praising her by Ashley Biden, President Joe Biden’s daughter. Harris visited Madison, Wisconsin, in March to promote Joe Biden’s agenda. News coverage of the day’s events do not mention Harris appearing drunk. Two social media videos claiming Harris was drunk at these events provide no evidence supporting the claims.","Vice President Kamala Harris’ critics on social media have long shared video clips of the Democratic presidential nominee speaking and insinuating she may be drunk or high. Many of the social media posts shared clips of Harris’ comments that have gone viral and said they show Harris was drunk — such as when Harris described her mother asking, ""You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?"" Two social media posts shared recently claim to show Harris was intoxicated at public events. One is from the Democratic National Convention’s first night. The other is from a March visit by Harris to Madison, Wisconsin. The first post shared a video of Harris remaining seated on the first night of the DNC in Chicago as those around her stood and applauded. ""Kamala Harris appears to be too intoxicated to stand up. This is getting bad,"" the Aug. 19 X post said. An Aug. 18 Instagram post shared a video of Harris speaking in Madison with text that said, ""BREAKING: Multiple police officers have come forward stating that Kamala is 100% intoxicated in this clip and she would’ve been charged with a DUI if she had been behind the wheel of a car."" PolitiFact has examined similar claims before about former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whom critics often accused of being drunk at public events — even though she doesn’t drink alcohol. We decided to look closer at these two videos to see whether there’s any evidence to back the claims Harris was drunk at these events. Harris at the DNC In the shortened DNC video clip shared on X, Ashley Biden, President Joe Biden’s daughter, spoke before introducing her father. Ashley Biden praised Harris, who was sitting, and said, ""She will beat Donald Trump again."" The camera showed a smiling Harris sitting in the audience. Harris stayed seated, patted her chest and mouthed ""thank you"" as those around her, including running mate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., stood and applauded for her. A PBS video of her speech, seen below, shows Ashley Biden praising Harris shortly before introducing her father, saying, ""In 2020, my dad selected Kamala Harris to beat Donald Trump. And he knows, in 2024, she will beat Donald Trump again."" Harris remained seated as the crowd cheered. But, minutes later, another video shows Harris stood and cheered as Joe Biden took the stage. After Biden’s speech, Harris walked onstage to greet him. Does sitting while others stood mean Harris was too drunk to stand? No. It’s not unusual for someone who is being applauded to remain seated, and the cheers were for Harris. The full video of the DNC’s first night, as you’ll see in the clips below, shows Harris standing to applaud others several times. About three hours into the video, Harris appeared onstage briefly to greet the crowd and praise Joe Biden. She stood steadily and did not appear to stumble or slurring her words. Later in the evening, Harris again stood and applauded as Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., praised Joe Biden. Harris again stood and applauded as former first lady Jill Biden took the stage. Harris in Madison The second video we’re examining is from Harris’ visit in March to Madison, Wisconsin, where she promoted a Biden executive order aimed at expanding apprenticeship programs and union jobs. In the Aug. 18 Instagram video , Harris discusses democracy as ominous music plays in the background. Text above the video said police officers had determined that Harris was intoxicated. We traced the video to an X account with more than 311,000 followers, where it had been viewed 11 million times, according to X. Neither post shared any evidence that police officers have ""come forward"" to say that Harris was intoxicated. The same X account, run by a self-described Trump supporter, shared another video that claimed Pelosi dropped a bag of cocaine onstage Aug. 21 at the DNC. It appeared to be a piece of paper that fell. In searching Google and the Nexis news database, we found no legitimate news stories about police officers making the Harris-was-intoxicated claim. The full video, which was from remarks Harris gave to Biden-Harris campaign workers in Madison, is below. Harris first appears at the 6:17 mark; the part seen in the Instagram video begins at the 12:40 mark. Harris’ visit was widely covered by local media outlets , none of which mentioned that Harris seemed intoxicated. According to a press pool report , Harris arrived at about 11:30 a.m. CDT at Dane County Regional Airport in Madison and headed to the future Madison Metro Transit Facility site, where she spoke . She then visited her childhood home in Madison, where she lived from age 3 to age 5, before stopping at the Wisconsin Democrats’ headquarters, where she spoke to campaign workers. Our ruling Two social media posts claimed Harris was intoxicated at public events. One said she was too drunk to stand on the DNC’s first night. Another said without evidence that police officers came forward to say Harris was intoxicated at a visit to Madison, Wisconsin, in March. While acknowledging that we would have no way to know Harris’ blood alcohol level in either instance, we found no evidence to support the claims. They are False.

Most immigrants living illegally in the U.S. are not eligible for benefits from federal programs, because the programs require Social Security numbers. Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are typically ineligible for federal Department of Housing and Urban Development housing programs. The Vance campaign said immigrants could obtain Social Security numbers and qualify for the program. However, the program’s eligibility requirements have not yet been revealed.","Sen. J.D. Vance, former President Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick, attacked Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign pledge to ease the burden costly down payments put on first-time homebuyers. ""Kamala Harris wants to give $25,000 to illegal aliens to buy American homes,"" the Ohio Republican wrote Aug. 16 on X . ""This will only further exacerbate the housing shortage in our country. It's a disgrace. We should be making it easier and more affordable for American citizens to buy homes."" The Vance campaign pointed PolitiFact to Harris’ recently announced proposal that would provide up to $25,000 for first-time homebuyers to put toward a down payment on a home. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, debuted the plan at an Aug. 16 campaign rally. She didn’t discuss technicalities, so it’s unclear how the policy would be carried out or who could qualify for the assistance. Here’s what we know. What is Harris’ down payment assistance proposal? Without providing much detail, Harris pledged down payment assistance. ""As the Harris-Walz plan starts to expand the supply of entry-level homes, they will, during their first term, provide working families who have paid their rent on time for two years and are buying their first home up to $25,000 in down payment assistance, with more generous support for first-generation homeowners,"" the campaign said in an Aug. 16 press release. Harris also mentioned the proposal — with less detail about who might qualify — at the aforementioned campaign rally , Aug 16 in Raleigh, North Carolina. ""We also know that as the cost of housing has gone up, the size of down payments have gone up as well,"" she said. ""Even if aspiring homeowners save for years, it often still is not enough. So, in addition, while we work on the housing shortage, my administration will provide first-time homebuyers with $25,000 to help with the down payment on a new home."" Harris did not provide many details on who would qualify, and it’s unclear what the proposed ""assistance"" would entail. Several news reports described it as ""assistance,"" The Washington Post described it as ""a $25,000 credit."" The Harris campaign did not address our questions seeking more detail. In practice, what might Harris’ plan look like? Harris’ plan builds on a similar March Biden proposal. Biden called on Congress to provide as much as $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers whose parents did not own homes. That plan is mentioned in the 2024 Democratic Party Platform , which Democrats formally adopted Aug. 19 at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Under Harris’ plan, people whose parents owned homes would also qualify for assistance. In March, Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., and six Democratic co-sponsors, introduced legislation that would provide up to $20,000 federal grants to help first-generation homebuyers with certain home purchase expenses, including their down payment and closing costs. Under the bill, a person would have qualified for grant assistance if he or she were a first-time and first-generation homebuyer whose income wasn’t more than 120% of the area’s median income (or 140% of the median income if the home being purchased was located in a high-cost area). Beyond that, the law’s implementation would depend on the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the state-level agencies administering the funding, a Warnock spokesperson said. That bill was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on March 12 , where it awaits further action. The Harris campaign did not say whether Warnock’s legislation aligned with her plan. Why did Vance claim an immigrant in the country illegally could qualify? The Vance campaign said that migrants who entered the U.S. illegally under the Biden-Harris administration could, over time, qualify for Harris’ down payment assistance proposal. For example, the Vance campaign told us that migrants awaiting a decision on their asylum claim — which could take years given the immigration court backlog — can be issued work permits and Social Security numbers. The Social Security Administration says that typically ""only noncitizens authorized to work in the United States by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can get an SSN."" A 2023 Congressional Research Service report found that ""unauthorized noncitizens"" — meaning foreign nationals who entered the U.S. ""without inspection,"" ""with fraudulent documents"" or who entered legally but overstayed ""the terms of their temporary stay"" — are not eligible for employment authorization or a work authorized Social Security number. The Social Security Administration can issue Social Security numbers that are ""not valid for employment"" to some noncitizens who are not authorized by the Department of Homeland Security to work in the U.S. if a federal law requires the noncitizen have a Social Security number to receive a benefit or service. Most immigrants living illegally in the U.S. are not eligible for benefits from federal programs , because the programs require Social Security numbers. Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are typically ineligible for federal Department of Housing and Urban Development housing programs. Our ruling Vance said ""Harris wants to give $25,000 to illegal aliens to buy American homes."" The GOP vice presidential nominee is filling in blanks about a proposal that we know little about. Harris has pledged to provide ""working families who have paid their rent on time for two years"" who are first-time homebuyers with $25,000 in down payment assistance. She has not detailed what the policy would entail or who would qualify. The Vance campaign argued that migrants could get Social Security numbers that might qualify them for down payment assistance. Social Security numbers are typically given only to noncitizens who are authorized to work in the U.S. At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the speaker. Having seen no specific details from Vance’s team that demonstrate Harris’ proposal would benefit immigrants in the country illegally, we rate his claim False.

"August 20, 2024",Tim Walz,Former President Donald Trump “cut overtime benefits for millions of workers.”,barely-true,"The Obama administration set a rule in 2016 to raise the salary threshold for white-collar workers to receive overtime pay. The administration said the rule would extend overtime pay to 4.2 million workers. A judge blocked the Obama rule in November 2016, before it took effect, and the incoming Trump administration did not challenge the court ruling, dropping the government’s appeal in 2017. The Trump administration set its own rule to raise the salary threshold for overtime pay, but by less than Obama’s rule. The Trump administration said it would extend overtime pay to 1.2 million workers.","Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told union workers in Los Angeles that a Trump-Vance administration would harm unions and diminish workers’ paychecks. Former President Donald Trump ""cut overtime benefits for millions of workers,"" Walz said at the Aug. 14 convention of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Walz mischaracterized what happened. When contacted for comment, the Harris-Walz campaign pointed to news articles showing that former President Barack Obama proposed to extend overtime pay eligibility to more workers, but a judge blocked it in November 2016, just before it was slated to take effect. The Trump administration did not challenge the judge’s ruling and instead set its own overtime rule , which extended overtime pay to millions fewer people than Obama’s rule would have done. The Obama rule was not in effect at the time Trump took office, so Trump’s administration did not cut an existing benefit. Overtime rules under Obama, Trump Most employees are eligible for time-and-a-half pay if they work more than 40 hours a week. But there are exceptions for white-collar workers. To be considered a white-collar worker by the federal government , an employee has to make more than $455 per week; be paid a salary rather than an hourly wage; and work in an administrative, executive or professional position. The Obama administration sought to boost the baseline amount salaried white-collar workers could earn and still qualify for overtime. So, in 2016, the administration said it would extend overtime eligibility to white-collar salaried workers earning less than $913 a week, or $47,476 a year. This was about double the exemption level set in 2004 of $455 per week, or $23,660 a year. (Hourly workers were already guaranteed overtime pay regardless of their earnings level). The change would have extended overtime pay eligibility to 4.2 million additional Americans , the Obama administration said. (Economists generated their own estimates , lower or higher, but still in the millions.) Republican-led states and business trade groups challenged the rule. A federal court in Texas halted Obama’s rule in November 2016, a week before it was to take effect. Because the judge threw out the rule, the overtime threshold annual pay reverted to $23,660, said Rachel Greszler, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. A few months after the judge struck down the Obama rule, Trump took office. Trump’s administration did not defend the Obama-era rule change, dropping the government’s appeal in 2017. The Trump administration proposed its own rule in 2019, with an earnings cutoff lower than the Obama rule but higher than the status quo. The Trump Labor Department’s overtime rule became effective Jan. 1, 2020, and raised the overtime pay eligibility to salaried workers earning $35,568 per year. The department estimated that 1.2 million additional workers would be eligible for overtime pay. Did the Trump changes constitute a cut? It wasn’t the case that millions of workers previously qualified for overtime pay and then Trump changed that. The Trump administration did not defend the Obama-era legal case. ""By abandoning the 2016 rule and eventually introducing a new one with a significantly lower salary threshold, the Trump administration excluded millions of workers who would have benefited from the 2016 rule’s new or strengthened overtime protections,"" said Jenn Round, director of Beyond the Bill, a program that advocates for labor standards enforcement at the Rutgers University Workplace Justice Lab. The president of the Economic Policy Institute, Heidi Shierholz, who served in the Obama administration as chief economist at the Labor Department, wrote in 2019 that the Trump administration’s rule left millions of workers behind. ""At its heart, the Trump administration’s rule is based on the notion that someone making $35,568 a year is a well-paid executive who doesn’t need or deserve overtime protections,"" Shierholz wrote. Rather than defend the Obama rule, ""Trump has sided with the interests of corporate executives over those of working people."" However, the notion that this represents a cut presumes that the courts would have upheld the Obama rule, which was far from a certainty. ""I cannot think of any way in which actions that the Trump Administration took could be construed as cutting overtime benefits,"" Greszler said. After the judge threw out Obama’s rule, the overtime threshold remained at $23,660, Greszler said. When Trump established a rule that increased the salary threshold to $35,568 ""this increased the number of workers subject to overtime rules,"" Greszler said. And the skirmish continues: The Biden-Harris administration set a rule, effective July 1, which initially raises the salary threshold for overtime pay to $844 per week, the equivalent of $43,888 annually. The threshold rises to $58,656 per year on Jan. 1, 2025. There are currently at least three lawsuits pending against that rule . Our ruling Walz said Trump ""cut overtime benefits for millions of workers."" In 2016, the Obama administration set a rule that would have raised the salary threshold for overtime pay. It said the change would extend overtime pay to 4.2 million more workers. But a judge struck it down before it took effect, and the incoming Trump administration dropped a challenge against the ruling. The statement has an element of truth because the decision not to continue the judicial appeal process meant the Trump administration gave up on the possibility of providing overtime eligibility to millions more workers compared with the Obama-era rule. But categorizing it as a cut is misleading because it relies on the assumption that Obama’s more expansive rule would have been approved by the courts, which was not a certainty. Trump’s administration did not take action to cut an existing benefit; the Obama rule was not in effect at the time Trump took office. We rate this Mostly False. "

"August 19, 2024",Donald Trump,California law lets you “rob a store as long as it’s not more than $950” and “not get charged.” Kamala Harris “did that.”,false,"Kamala Harris was California’s attorney general in 2014 when voters approved Proposition 47, a ballot initiative aimed at reducing the state’s overcrowded prison population. The bill said people convicted of shoplifting items valued at $950 or less can be charged only with a misdemeanor, not a felony. The $950 threshold already existed, having been signed into law by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2010. Proposition 47 affirmed it and addressed more theft categories. Harris had no role in creating the ballot initiative and remained publicly neutral about it, experts said.","At a news conference at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, former President Donald Trump blamed Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris for a 2014 California law he falsely said allowed shoplifters to steal from retailers without consequence. ""You're allowed to rob a store as long as it's not more than $950. Has everyone ever heard of that?"" Trump said Aug. 15. ""You can rob a store, and you have these thieves going into stores with calculators, calculating how much it is, because if it's less than $950 they can rob it and not get charged. That was her that did that."" Trump was referring to Proposition 47, a 2014 California voter-approved law, ""which makes the theft of stolen property worth less than $950 a misdemeanor charge rather than a felony,"" Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson said, linking to a June 12 San Francisco Chronicle article about the law and a new ballot initiative that could roll back some of its provisions. That article mentions neither that Harris was involved in creating the law, nor that thefts of less than $950 bring no charges. The article also noted that other states, including Republican-led Texas at $2,500 , have higher financial thresholds to meet felony charges for theft. California’s law did reduce some nonviolent crimes from felonies to misdemeanors and did include a $950 felony threshold on retail thefts. But Trump’s comments mislead about the law and Harris’ role in its creation. What is Proposition 47? Proposition 47 was a ballot initiative created in response to a court ruling that ordered California to reduce its prison population because of overcrowding. Then-San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón and former San Diego Police Chief William Lansdowne co-authored the bill, with collaboration from nonprofits such as Stanford’s Justice Advocacy Project and Californians for Safety and Justice, said UC Law San Francisco professor Hadar Aviram. Proposition 47 downgraded some nonviolent drug and property crimes to misdemeanors. A summary Harris’ office prepared in 2014, said the law ""requires misdemeanor sentence instead of felony for the following crimes when amount involved is $950 or less: petty theft, receiving stolen property, and forging/writing bad checks."" Under state law before Proposition 47, shoplifting property worth $950 or less was often a misdemeanor, but such crimes could, in some cases, also be charged as a burglary, which could be a felony, Harris’ summary said. Proposition 47 said shoplifting property under that threshold would always be considered a misdemeanor. The proposition defined ""shoplifting,"" a misdemeanor, in the state’s penal code as ""entering a commercial establishment with the intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours"" and the value of property taken is $950 or less. Entering a retail store with the intent to steal when a store is not open is burglary, which could be a felony. The $950 threshold in Proposition 47, however, was not new to state law. The California Legislature in 2010 passed Assembly Bill 2372 , which set a $950 threshold between petty theft (a misdemeanor) and grand larceny (a felony), raising it to account for inflation from $400, a threshold set in 1982. Then-Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed that change into law. Proposition 47 essentially affirmed that threshold and addressed a few more theft categories, such as auto thefts and thefts of some agricultural products, that the 2010 legislation didn’t address, experts told PolitiFact. Proposition 47 passed with 59% of voters supporting the ballot measure. Harris, in the same election, was reelected as attorney general. The law has been controversial, with critics blaming it for increasing retail crime. Voters in November will consider Proposition 36 , which would mandate drug treatment and allow for felony sentences for certain drug and theft crimes. It would leave the $950 threshold intact, but allow felony charges for people with two or more previous theft convictions. California’s $950 threshold for a theft felony is lower than in 39 states, plus the District of Columbia, a list provided by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows. Does Proposition 47 let people steal without being charged? No, theft of any amount is still a crime in California, Aviram said. ""Theft of less than $950 is a misdemeanor, theft of $950 or more is grand theft, which is a felony,"" Aviram said. ""Both are criminal offenses, and both are prosecutable and punishable."" People convicted of misdemeanor shoplifting still face penalties of up to six months in jail and/or fines of up to $1,000. People with prior theft convictions or registered sex offenders could face more severe penalties under the state’s penal code. Will Matthews, a spokesperson for Californians for Safety and Justice , an advocacy group that co-authored Proposition 47, called Trump’s comments about the law ""patently absurd."" ""Crime is still crime in California,"" Matthews said. ""Misdemeanors in California are still punishable"" with jail time. Matthews said the underlying idea of Proposition 47 was to make people committing low-level crimes eligible for local jail sentences instead of state prison, which would save taxpayers money. What was Harris’ involvement? Harris wasn’t involved in creating or passing Proposition 47. As attorney general, she wrote only the proposal’s title and language about it on the state ballot. Harris’ campaign did not return a request for comment, but Matthews said she was not involved in the law’s creation, and multiple news outlets have reported that Harris remained publicly neutral on the bill. ""She played really no role in Proposition 47 at all,"" Matthews said. ""She was the attorney general of the state of California at the time that Proposition 47 was on the ballot, and as the attorney general, when it comes to ballot initiatives like that, her responsibility is to be neutral."" Harris, as part of her duties, was responsible for verifying that the proposal met the number of signatures required to be added to the state ballot. But ""she didn’t endorse or oppose Proposition 47 when it was on the ballot,"" Matthews said. Stanford University Law Professor Robert Weisberg, co-director of its Criminal Justice Center, said Harris was ""resolutely neutral"" on Proposition 47, as ""she was on almost all major reform initiatives"" while she was attorney general. ""She had a kind of ministerial role in editing the language of the proposition to make it comply with state constitutional law,"" Weisberg said. That is typically how ballot initiatives in California work, Aviram said. ""Voter initiatives in California are authored by lobbying groups and nonprofits. They are submitted to the Attorney General's office for official title and summary , but the responsibility for their crafting ultimately lies with whoever proposes them and collects enough signatures to put them on the ballot,"" Aviram said in an email. Some Republicans opposed to the law criticized Harris, saying she misrepresented the bill in a summary her office wrote. One California assemblymember said she misled voters by titling the bill the ""Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act,"" but that was the title the bill’s authors had proposed. Harris had titled it, ""Criminal Sentences. Misdemeanor Penalties. Initiative Statute,"" which was the version printed on the ballot. Our ruling Trump said Harris was responsible for a California law that lets people steal with no penalties as long as the goods are valued at $950 or less. He’s wrong on two counts. There is a $950 threshold cited in Proposition 47 between a misdemeanor or felony theft charge in the state. A 2010 law a Republican governor signed set that threshold. Proposition 47 reaffirmed that threshold. The law doesn’t say there are no penalties for stealing under that amount: Misdemeanor theft carries penalties of up to six months in jail and a fine. Harris was California’s attorney general when voters approved the 2014 law. A spokesperson for a group that co-authored Proposition 47 said Harris had no involvement in crafting the bill. Experts and news reports show Harris remained publicly neutral on the initiative. A Trump spokesperson provided no evidence that Harris was responsible for drafting the law, or that people can steal without consequences. We rate the claim False. "

"August 16, 2024",Social Media,Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed a bill “redefining ‘sexual orientation’ to include pedophiles.”,false,"The bill, called the ""Take Pride Act,"" updated the definition of ""sexual orientation"" and ""gender identity"" in the Minnesota Human Rights Act. It didn’t include pedophiles in these definitions, nor did it give pedophiles legal protections. Legal experts told PolitiFact that laws prohibiting discrimination because of sexual orientation do not protect pedophiles, even if they do not include that specific disclaimer. In Minnesota, an adult who engages in sexual conduct with a minor can be charged with a first-degree felony, which is punishable by up to 30 years of imprisonment, a fine of up to $40,000 or both.","Republicans claim Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz approved legal protections for pedophiles as Minnesota governor. RNC Research, an X account run by former President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee, posted Aug. 6 that Walz signed a bill into law ""removing ‘physical or sexual attachment to children by an adult’ from (Minnesota’s) human rights law — redefining ‘sexual orientation’ to include pedophiles."" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., reshared this X post and wrote, ""Anyone who extends equal rights protections to pedophiles has no business anywhere near the White House."" Conservative commentator and podcast host Isabel Brown made a similar claim on Instagram. The caption of her Aug. 7 post read, ""Last February, the state of Minnesota (& Governor Walz) updated the law’s definition of s*xual orientation to SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE adults who are attracted to children in a physical or s*xual manner."" And an Aug. 9 Threads post claimed Walz signed a bill that ""made pedophiles a protected class in Minnesota."" (Screengrabs from X and Instagram) The Instagram and Threads posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. These claims mislead about the measure, called the ""Take Pride Act,"" which did not add protections for pedophiles. It clarified definitions for sexual orientation and gender identity in the state’s human rights law. It doesn’t include pedophiles in these definitions, nor does it give pedophiles legal protections. Democratic state Rep. Leigh Finke, Minnesota’s first transgender legislator, introduced the bill, House File 1655 , in February 2023. It passed the Legislature as part of a larger public safety bill , and Walz signed it into law in May 2023. The Take Pride Act amended the existing definition of ""sexual orientation"" in the Human Rights Act and created a new definition for ""gender identity."" Both were already protected classes under Minnesota law. The Minnesota Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations, public services, education, credit and business based on race, religion, disability, national origin, sex, marital status, familial status, age, sexual orientation and gender identity. During a March 2023 state House panel discussion of the bill, Finke said it ""modernizes"" the Human Rights Act, ""bringing a more contemporary understanding"" of sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill amended the definition of ""sexual orientation"" to remove a line that said: ""‘Sexual orientation’ does not include a physical or sexual attachment to children by an adult."" Critics have pointed to that change as proof the measure added protections for pedophiles. But lawmakers who supported the bill said the updated language aimed to sever any perceived ties between pedophilia and a person’s sexual orientation. In May 2023, before the bill passed, PolitiFact fact-checked a similar claim that the bill would make it ""illegal to discriminate against child rapists."" We rated this False . Legal experts we interviewed in May 2023 said laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation do not protect pedophiles, even if they do not include that specific disclaimer. Minnesota statutes already specify that sexual orientation is about having attachments to another person regardless of that person’s sex, not that person’s age, Brian Soucek, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, told PolitiFact in May 2023. ""No court in the country has or would ever say that a law protecting people from discrimination based on their sexual orientation extends to protecting pedophilia,"" Soucek said. Democratic state Rep. Jamie Becker-Finn said during an April 26, 2023, legislative session that the provision amending the ""sexual orientation"" definition had ""gone off the rails a bit on social media."" ""Nothing in the bill changes or weakens any of the crimes against children in our criminal statute, or the state’s ability to prosecute those who break the law. Of course pedophilia is not a protected class, is not a sexual orientation, which is why the language never should have been in the bill in the first place,"" Becker-Finn said. Before the bill passed, Republican state Rep. Harry Niska added language to the bill that said: ""The physical or sexual attachment to children by an adult is not a protected class under this chapter."" But lawmakers later removed this language, and it was not included in the final text of the bill that Walz signed, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported. In Minnesota, penetration with a person younger than 18 or sexual contact with a person younger than 14 is subject to a charge of first-degree criminal sexual conduct , punishable by up to 30 years of imprisonment, a fine of up to $40,000, or both.

"August 16, 2024",Pete Buttigieg,Gov. Tim Walz delivered paid family leave in Minnesota but “Republicans are blocking” a Biden-Harris proposal.,mostly-true,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed a bill in 2023 that provides paid family leave starting in January 2026. Democrats in Congress have proposed the Family Act since 2013, but this paid family leave plan has not progressed. President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better proposal initially included four weeks of paid family leave, but Sen. Joe Manchin, then a Democrat, objected to the bill. Without Republican support, that doomed the bill. The legislation that became the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act did not include family leave.","Transportation Department Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a frequent cable news surrogate for Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris, praised the track record of her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. On CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" Buttigieg rebutted rhetoric from Republican presidential nominee and Ohio Sen. JD Vance about Democrats being ""antifamily."" ""So, if you want to talk about promoting children, promoting family, put your money where your mouth is,"" Buttigieg said Aug. 11. ""Same with a lot of other policies, like, I don't know, paid family leave, something that Tim Walz delivered in Minnesota, something that the Biden-Harris administration sought to deliver for the American people. Right now, Republicans are blocking it, but that's something that they could certainly change their tune on, but they haven't."" Buttigieg was responding to Vance’s comment earlier in the show that ""our country has become antifamily in its public policy."" Vance has gotten backlash over two interviews he gave in 2021, one in which he said the U.S was being run by "" a bunch of childless cat ladies ."" We decided to examine Buttigieg’s claim about Walz signing paid family leave in Minnesota and whether ""Republicans are blocking"" it on the federal level. We found that Walz signed paid family leave into law in 2023. The state program won’t take effect until 2026. As for Buttigieg blaming Republicans for the lack of a federal family leave policy, the Biden White House pointed to the stalled Build Back Better legislation and the Family Act , a longtime Democratic bill. The White House also highlighted Republican opposition to a family leave proposal in Michigan, where a Michigan House GOP memo described a Democratic proposal as ""a new tax to pay for summer break for adults."" Minnesota is among 13 states to enact mandatory paid family leave In 2022, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party in Minnesota flipped the Senate and maintained control of the House, and Walz won a second term as governor. That trifecta allowed the party to pass paid medical and family leave after a yearslong push . Walz signed a bill in May 2023 to provide up to 12 weeks of paid medical leave for employees and up to 12 weeks of family leave, which includes bonding with a child, caring for a family member, supporting survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and supporting for active-duty deployments domestically or abroad. There is a maximum of 20 weeks available in a benefit year if someone takes both medical and family leave. The state will pay leave benefits in the program, which applies to small and large businesses and takes effect in January 2026 . Recipients will be paid based on a formula . The maximum weekly benefit payment for eligible workers is equal to the state average weekly wage ($1,337 in 2023). ""By signing paid family and medical leave into law, we’re ensuring Minnesotans no longer have to make the choice between a paycheck and taking time off to care for a new baby or a sick family member,"" Walz said in May 2023. The state used a projected budget surplus to jump-start the program; funding will then shift to a payroll tax split between employers and workers. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center , 13 states and the District of Columbia have enacted mandatory paid family leave systems. Federal paid family leave efforts have stalled The U.S. is an outlier on paid maternity and parental leave. Polls show widespread support , including by Republicans, but Congress has not passed legislation. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) requires 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually for parents of newborn or newly adopted children if the parents work for a company with 50 or more employees. In 2020, the policy was extended to caregivers of sick family members. The law applies only to unpaid leave. Every Congress since 2013 has filed the Family Act to create paid leave for workers. The current version, introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. , with a counterpart in the House , has only Democratic co-sponsors and has not received a vote. That legislation is modeled on what has worked in the states’ legislation, said Vicki Shabo, an expert on paid family leave at New America, a left-leaning think tank. Jane Waldfogel, a paid leave expert and a Columbia University School of Social Work professor, told PolitiFact that Republicans are more supportive of paid leave than they’ve been in the past, but that there are disagreements about who should be covered and how the leave would be funded. ""Democrats favor a comprehensive bill that would cover paid family and medical leave for new parents and those needing leave for their own serious illness or to care for a seriously ill family member, while Republicans have focused on leave for new parents only,"" Waldfogel said. ""And Democrats favor a social insurance model, while Republicans instead have proposed that workers would draw funds from their future (Social Security) or child tax credits."" Some Republicans have taken steps toward expanding paid parental leave, but those efforts have fallen short for most workers. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump backed six weeks of paid maternity leave. In 2020, he supported an idea by his daughter and adviser Ivanka to provide paid maternity leave. He didn’t keep the campaign promise for all workers, but he did sign a law offering most federal employees 12 weeks of paid leave for the arrival of a child. (That left out the other 150 million-plus workers outside the federal government.) In 2018, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla , introduced a bill to let new parents borrow from their future Social Security benefits to pay for their child-related leave. Supporters liked it because it created no new taxes, but critics said it would hurt low-income workers. It drew zero co-sponsors. Biden promised in the 2020 campaign that he would create a national paid family and medical leave program that would allow all employees to take up to 12 weeks of paid time off. The promise is Stalled on our Biden Promise Tracker . After originally being negotiated out of Biden's sweeping Build Back Better spending bill framework , the family leave provision returned in a more limited form. The spending bill that passed the House in November 2021 included four weeks of paid annual family and medical leave. It had no Republican support. The package had provisions about clean energy, child tax credits and health care and included additional taxes on wealthy Americans. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., spoke for more than eight hours about his objections, predicting it would be bad for the economy. But in the Senate, Joe Manchin, then D-W.Va., objected to the bill’s social policy spending on child tax credits and paid leave; this and Republican opposition doomed the bill’s chances in the Senate. (Manchin later became an independent.) Republicans opposed the legislation, saying it was too expensive. ""The best Christmas gift Washington could give working families would be putting this bad bill on ice,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said about a week before Christmas in 2021. The bill that earned Manchin’s support and passed the Senate in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act, was limited mostly to policies on climate change, health care and corporate taxation, and omitted family and medical leave. Since then, a bipartisan House working group has released a policy framework for paid leave but has yet not released a new bill. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a leader of a bicameral working group , said in a July 30 virtual discussion about paid leave, ""The key thing is how do you pay for it, that’s the rub."" Our ruling Buttitieg said Walz delivered paid family leave in Minnesota but ""Republicans are blocking"" a Biden-Harris proposal. Walz signed a bill in May 2023 to provide for paid family leave. It takes effect in 2026. Republicans, citing spending concerns, have broadly resisted federal paid family leave similar to the kind Walz signed into law. Trump failed to expand paid leave to all workers when he was president. In 2021, Biden’s Build Back Better proposal, which included four weeks of paid family leave annually along with many other programs, failed to garner enough support when all Republicans and then-Democratic Sen. Manchin opposed it. A bipartisan group of federal lawmakers have taken steps to research paid family leave, but it hasn’t led to a bill. Democrats have proposed paid family leave bills akin to what Walz signed for a decade. The statement is accurate about Walz’s record but needs clarification about why family leave has not passed at the federal level. We rate this statement Mostly True.

"August 15, 2024",Instagram posts,Kamala Harris voted in favor of passing a law in 2022 to tax tips.,false,Tips were federally taxed before Vice President Kamala Harris voted in favor of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. The IRS’ tip reporting program is unrelated to the Inflation Reduction Act. It was introduced in 2023 as a way for employers in the service industry to voluntarily report tips. Similar tip compliance programs have existed since 1993.,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both said they would stop taxing tips in their bid for the presidency. But some people online have called Harris hypocritical, accusing her of voting in 2022 to tax service workers’ tips. An Instagram post shows a video of Harris voting for the Inflation Reduction Act. Text overlaying the video reads, ""Kamala Harris Hopes Service Workers Forget She was the Tie-Breaking Vote for the IRS to GO AFTER TIPS!"" The video then claims that the Inflation Reduction Act hired 87,000 IRS agents to launch a tip reporting site. ""KAMALA TAXED YOUR TIPS,"" another text layer says. This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. People have had to pay federal taxes on tips for decades, long before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed. In 2021, the IRS said it planned to hire more than 86,000 new employees over 10 years. But those employees would not all be working in enforcement. And the IRS tip reporting program is a voluntary program that would replace existing tax compliance programs. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act increased taxes on large corporations, including companies making more than $1 billion in three years. It also gave an additional $80 billion to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The claim that the IRS would hire 87,000 IRS agents came from a 2021 Department of Treasury report that said the IRS would use the $80 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act to hire 86,852 full-time employees. PolitiFact previously found that the new hires would not work solely as auditors or in enforcement. Some of the additional funding would also go toward operations support, taxpayer services and modernizing the agency’s business system, a congressional research report showed. The IRS did propose a tip reporting program in 2023 that would let service industry employers report tips voluntarily to help with tax compliance. The program is not entirely new. It would replace three other tip compliance agreements that have existed since 1993 . Our ruling Kamala Harris did not vote for a law that taxed service workers’ tips. Tips have been federally taxed for decades. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act allocated $80 billion to hire 87,000 full-time IRS employees. Those employees would be hired in a 10-year period, meaning the 87,000 new employees could not all be hired to launch the agency’s tip reporting program. The IRS did start a program in 2023 in which employers could voluntarily report tips to the IRS. That program is not a new concept and was intended to replace three similar tip compliance programs. We rate the claim that Kamala Harris voted in favor of passing a law in 2022 to tax tips False. PolitiFact Staff Writer Loreben Tuquero contributed to this report. "
"August 15, 2024",Instagram posts,"Videos of media talking about Tim Walz as a ""happy warrior"" are proof of government propaganda legalized by Barack Obama.",false,"Vice President Kamala Harris and her presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have sought to portray themselves as ""joyful warriors."" News reports and cable news pundits have reported on this approach, and many referred to Walz as a ""happy warrior,"" a common political nickname that dates back at least 100 years. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was first elected president in 1932, used it in a speech about New York Gov. Al Smith at the 1924 Democratic National Convention. The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012, signed into law by President Barack Obama, did not legalize propaganda in the U.S. The law, which has no effect on privately owned news outlets, eased U.S. broadcast restrictions on government-funded media, such as Voice of America.","On the presidential campaign trail, Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have sought to cultivate an image of a positive, joyful message to contrast what they say is Republican nominee Donald Trump’s negative campaign. Walz says, ""We are joyful warriors,"" Harris recounted Aug. 7 at an Eau Claire, Wisconsin rally, their second joint appearance. It’s been a common theme in their subsequent appearances together. Many news outlets and opinion pieces have reported on the Harris-Walz strategy, with some referring to Walz as a "" happy warrior, "" chosen by Harris because of his upbeat personality . An Aug. 13 Instagram post saw a more sinister motive in the media reporting, and blamed a former Democratic president. The Instagram post shared a video that showed multiple cable news clips with journalists or pundits referring to Walz as a ""happy warrior."" The Instagram video’s caption called it ""extreme propaganda,"" and said it was rooted in a Barack Obama-era law. ""It used to be illegal to use media outlets to push propaganda on the American people, it was still covertly done but not as bad as this,"" the caption said. ""Obama legalized government propaganda during his time as president. … Obama’s change to the law is why we are seeing so many news clips all repeating the same Democrat talking points."" But the statement mischaracterizes a law passed during Obama's administration that was related to government-produced media content, not privately owned media such as the cable news outlets seen in the Instagram video. The nickname ‘happy warrior’ has a long political history The term can be traced to "" The Character of the Happy Warrior ,"" a 1807 William Wordsworth poem that described someone being brave, generous, having strong morals and other positive traits that ""every man in arms should wish to be."" The term emerged in politics by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1924, when Roosevelt used it in a speech to describe New York Gov. Alfred Smith while unsuccessfully nominating Smith to be the Democrats’ presidential nominee at the party’s national convention in New York. One Roosevelt scholar said a Smith adviser had added the term to Roosevelt’s speech, The Federalist wrote . The nickname has been applied to multiple politicians since, including former Republican President Ronald Reagan and former Democratic Vice President and Minnesota Sen. Hubert Humphrey . Harris and Walz have embraced this image. ""Thank you for bringing back the joy,"" Walz told Harris after she introduced him as her running mate Aug. 6 in Philadelphia. The next day at a campaign stop in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Harris said , ""And understand, in this fight, as Tim Walz likes to point out, we are joyful warriors."" She again used the term ""joyful warriors"" the same day at a Detroit rally. Walz accused Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, of trying to ""steal the joy"" from the country. ""Our next president brings the joy. She emanates the joy,"" Walz said. Both Harris and Walz referred to campaigning with ""joy"" at an Aug. 9 Glendale, Arizona, rally. At an Aug. 10 Las Vegas rally, Walz again said Harris ""brought out the joy in our politics"" and said their work is tough, "" but we can be happy doing it ."" What does this have to do with Obama? Despite the Instagram video’s attempt to link the network reporting on this to Obama, it has no connection to the former president. (Although Obama did use the term ""happy warrior"" to describe then-Vice President Joe Biden in 2012.) The Instagram post’s narrator referred to a law change during Obama’s administration that she said ""legalized government propaganda"" and led to the news outlets ""repeating the same Democratic talking points."" The post didn’t specify the law but it’s likely referring to Obama’s signing in 2012 of the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 , which PolitiFact found was the subject of misinformation in 2019. False social media posts in recent years have said the law legalized government propaganda in the U.S. The law has no effect on independent, privately owned media outlets, such as CNN, NBC and MSNBC, which were shown in the Instagram video. The bill Obama signed removed some restrictions on U.S.-funded and generated news produced for overseas audiences from being broadcast to U.S. audiences, such as programming produced by the U.S. Agency for Global Media , which ""broadcasts news and information about the United States and the world to audiences abroad."" Among those programs run by the agency are Voice of America , an international broadcaster that reaches an audience of more than 350 million people worldwide. Other agency programs include Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty , Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks . Before the law was passed, those outlets’ programming could be viewed or listened to in broadcast quality only in foreign countries. Much of that programming was already available in the U.S. online. The change in the law allows content produced by the government to be made available in broadcast quality in the U.S. upon request. Our ruling An Instagram post said videos of media talking about Walz as a ""happy warrior"" are proof of government propaganda legalized by Barack Obama. The Harris-Walz ticket has sought to portray itself as ""joyful warriors."" Many news outlets reported on this strategy and used the term ""happy warrior"" to describe Walz. It’s a common political nickname that has been given to U.S. politicians since at least 1924. An Obama-era law eased U.S. broadcast restrictions for government-funded news, such as what’s produced by the U.S. Agency for Global Media.

"August 14, 2024",Charlie Kirk,"“During Covid, Tim Walz rationed access to monoclonal antibody treatments based on skin color.”",barely-true,"Minnesota’s health department had a centralized program from February 2021 to July 2022 to refer patients for monoclonal antibody treatments based on clinical need. For about one month of the 16-month program, the increase of risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes for Black, Indigenous and other people of color because of disparate health impacts was considered a health factor in a scoring system used to prioritize treatment referrals. Race was no longer a scoring factor during a weighted lottery period in early 2022, when monoclonal antibody supplies were lowest and some lower-risk patients were denied referrals.","Shortly after Vice President Kamala Harris tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her presidential running mate, he faced increased scrutiny over how he led his state during the coronavirus pandemic’s apex. One claim is that a Minnesota health department program that sought to ensure equitable distribution of monoclonal antibody treatments discriminated against white people. ""During Covid, Tim Walz rationed access to monoclonal antibody treatments based on skin color. Being non-white gave a person more priority than having hypertension, and was equal in importance to having massive risk factors like diabetes or cardiovascular disease,"" conservative political activist Charlie Kirk wrote Aug. 6 on Threads . ""How many people did Walz kill because he thought they were less deserving due to their race?"" We contacted a Kirk spokesperson for evidence supporting his claim but received no response. We also found other social media posts making the same claim . The notion that access to the treatments was rationed by race and that may have led to the deaths of white people is false and ignores key details about Minnesota’s policy, experts told PolitiFact. The Minnesota Department of Health said the Food and Drug Administration acknowledged that race and ethnicity ""may also place individual patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19."" That risk may not be determined by underlying conditions alone, possibly because of underdiagnosis of other diseases in Black, Indigenous and people of color populations. To account for that, Minnesota developed a scoring system that factored in race to determine who would be prioritized for the antibody treatments. This system was in effect for about one month of the program’s 16-month duration. The state had abandoned the scoring system by the time a weighted lottery system was needed when monoclonal antibody treatment supplies were lowest. A November 2023 case study showed that at least 79% of the people the program referred to get monoclonal antibody treatments were white. White people constitute 77% of the state’s 5.7 million-person population . The Harris-Walz campaign defended Walz’s pandemic actions as governor. ""Americans haven't forgotten that at the height of the pandemic, states were forced to ration treatments for COVID-19 because Donald Trump failed to deliver the resources to keep our families safe and healthy,"" Sarafina Chitika, a campaign spokesperson, said in an email. ""As Governor, Tim Walz made sure treatments for COVID were delivered to patients who needed them most in order to save as many lives as possible despite Trump's failures."" What happened in Minnesota? Monoclonal antibody treatments use laboratory-made proteins that mimic a person’s immune system to fight off viruses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization as early as November 2020 for several of these products to treat COVID-19. These treatments, administered in outpatient settings, helped reduce the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. Monoclonal antibody treatments were sometimes in short supply during pandemic surges. Minnesota in February 2021 launched the Minnesota Resource Allocation Platform, a program to equitably connect patients with the treatments based on clinical need. The program ran from Feb. 9, 2021, to July 1, 2022. The goal, said J.P. Leider, a University of Minnesota associate public health professor who helped lead the project , was to have a centralized system to give any Minnesotan access to the treatments based on clinical data, rather than a first-come, first served policy that many states used. The policy involved prioritizing access to the treatments. It first prioritized referrals for the treatment based on FDA criteria for identifying high-risk patients laid out in the agency’s emergency use authorizations, which changed over time. Besides multiple health conditions, the FDA said in May and July 2021 that race or ethnicity may place patients at ""high risk for progression to severe COVID-19"" partly because of other potentially undiagnosed health concerns. Minnesota later designed a scoring system first used in December 2021 that assigned people points, on a scale of zero to 25, based on categories of clinical risk from COVID-19, The program used the Mayo Clinic’s Monoclonal Antibody Screening Score , but added categories for pregnant women and Black, Indigenous and people of color as risk factors. The state’s Health Department said the score was adapted after studies showed pregnant women and Black people, Indigenous people and people of color ""were independently associated with poor clinical outcomes from COVID-19 infection."" Minnesota’s scoring system awarded: Four points: to pregnant women; patients who are immunocompromised. Three points: to people with chronic kidney disease; patients 55 years and older with chronic respiratory disease. Two points: to people ages 65 years or older; people with body mass indexes of 35 kg/m2 and higher; people with diabetes; cardiovascular disease in a patient 55 years and older; Black, Indigenous or people of color status. One point: to patients 55 years and older with hypertension, which is also known as high blood pressure. Race alone wouldn’t put people in the highest priority group unless they were older or had other risk factors. Some critics and legal scholars questioned Minnesota’s approach at the time. Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor who criticized Minnesota’s policy in a 2022 essay , told PolitiFact that considering race in rationing medical care ""would generally be unconstitutional."" ""I set aside unusual situations where race is directly medically relevant — for instance, if some medicine works well for East Asians but not for whites, or some such. That, as I understand it, was not at all relevant to COVID treatments."" Minnesota on Jan. 12, 2022, removed race as a scoring factor for the rest of the program amid complaints about discrimination and threats of a lawsuit by America First Legal, a group started by Stephen Miller, once an adviser to former President Donald Trump. Objections to using race as a factor in treatment allocation were also raised in Utah and New York . Scores for other health risks remained unchanged in Minnesota’s program, although pregnancy was also removed as a factor because pregnant people ""are clinically prioritized, independent"" of their score, the health department said. The state, in its announcement, did not explain why Black, Indigenous or people of color status was removed as a scoring factor. Andrea Ahneman, a Minnesota Department of Health spokesperson, in a written statement said the department issues health guidance ""based on the best available information at the time, and updates guidance as new information emerges."" ""The Emergency Use Authorizations for the monoclonals noted factors including age, medical conditions, and race and ethnicity could put individual patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. Based on this information and other clinical analysis that showed increased risk for severe illness for people of color, there was a short period of time where a Minnesota guidance document noted race among the considerations for getting a referral for monoclonal antibodies,"" Ahneman said. ""That guidance had changed by the time Minnesota was short of monoclonal supply and running a lottery."" Dan Wikler, a Harvard University ethics and population health professor, said pandemic-era points systems for weighing allocation of life-saving resources, such as vaccines and therapeutics, arose after debate among health professionals and usually came from institutions such as universities or the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Other institutions then adapted these systems, he said; this is what happened in Minnesota. The state’s scoring system was adapted from the Mayo Clinic’s system. It’s ""ludicrous"" to attribute those health plans to Walz or any other governor, Wikler said. ""Very few would have had any idea of what was going on in these debates, and surely would have been unable to tell you what the guidelines for these institutions were,"" he said. Wikler said the debates centered on balancing twin goals — using resources to do the most good and ensuring that everyone had a fair chance to benefit. ""There is no way to honor both of these goals fully. Among those contributing to the discussion of the ethics of these choices, people of good will often reached very different conclusions,"" Wikler said. Why was race initially used? Minnesota’s health department cited the FDA’s guidance in 2021 emergency-use approvals for monoclonal antibody treatments that ""in addition to certain underlying health conditions, race and ethnicity ""may also place individual patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19."" That ""acknowledgment means that race and ethnicity alone, apart from other underlying health conditions, may be considered in determining eligibility for (monoclonal antibodies),"" the health department said in its ""ethical framework"" about allocation of the treatments. ""That was based on scientific evidence at the population health level that was showing us every single day that Black people and Latino people were experiencing worse symptoms and were more likely to be hospitalized and more likely to die from the COVID-19 virus,"" University of Minnesota health and racial equity professor Rachel Hardeman said. Provisional age-adjusted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that Black people; Hispanics; American Indian or Alaska Natives; and Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders all had higher COVID-19 death rates than whites. American Indians and Alaska Natives were about twice as likely to die from COVID-19, and Hispanic, Black, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders were about 1.5 times as likely to die. Hardeman said those disparities were worse during the pandemic’s height. ""In Minnesota, for instance, in January of 2022 we saw that Black people, while just comprising about 6% of the population in Minnesota, were actually 11% of the COVID-19 hospitalizations for quite some time,"" Hardeman said. ""Certainly those numbers fluctuated, but there was always consistently a gap based on race, which is why this decision was made."" Does that mean white people were discriminated against? Kirk’s claim that Minnesota rationed health care by skin color has elements of truth in that a scoring system awarded patients who were Black, Indigenous or people of color 2 points, the same as patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease and more than a patient with hypertension. But it ignores several facts and implies, with no evidence, that the scoring system led to deaths of white people. ""I don't have data that shows that (the program led to white people dying). I don't have reason to think that,"" Leider, the public health professor, said. ""What I'll say about the state of Minnesota is that we set up a system where anybody could come in and get a referral. Didn't matter if they had a doctor who knew about this or not, and because of the demographics of our state that we are, especially in the older group, whiter, I think that our system demonstrably prevented hospitalizations and hopefully saved lives, compared to a lot of the other states that were just letting it be first come first serve."" Leider pointed to a 2022 study of Medicare patients that showed nationwide, people with no chronic diseases were five times likelier to receive monoclonal antibody treatments than people with six or more chronic conditions. A 2022 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report also showed much lower use of the treatments among Black, Asian, Hispanic and other races compared with white patients. Dr. Monica Peek, a University of Chicago professor for health justice of medicine, said some public health officials used race as a proxy for exposure to racism, which she said limits access to goods and services and increases exposure to risks and harms. Racialized minorities, she said, have increased risk for chronic diseases and were at an increased risk for COVID-19 exposure. Many front-line workers who had increased risk of contracting COVID-19, such as hospital and grocery store workers, were Black and brown, she said. The attempts to ""try to mitigate the exposure to racism when we're trying to allocate resources is really an attempt to mitigate the harm that racial and ethnic minorities have been exposed to,"" Peek said. ""And so it's not trying to increase the harm for white people. It's trying to decrease the harm for Black and brown people."" States and cities used different strategies to equitably allocate resources fairly and ensure populations most at risk received resources first, using factors such as chronic diseases or age. How Minnesota’s system worked in practice Minnesota’s weighted scoring system with race as a factor was in place from early December 2021 to early January 2022. It was used for less than a month of the 16 months the program operated. We ""did not use race/ethnicity during (the) lottery, when stuff was at its shortest,"" Leider said. It ""was used for a small time before that, based on clinical guidance, that showed being BIPOC was associated with worse outcomes even after controlling for comorbidities, age, what have you. But that went away before (the) lottery was needed."" A case study Leider and other researchers published shows that 31,559 people received referrals through the program to get monoclonal antibody treatments to treat COVID-19 or for protection postexposure. Of the 29,281 people who received it for treatment of the virus, at least 79% were white . About 11% declined to provide a race or ethnicity, and about 9% were people of color, including Black, Asian, American Indian, Native Hawaiian, Hispanic/Latino or other, the data shows. Our ruling Kirk claimed that in Minnesota, Walz rationed access to monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID-19 based on skin color, and that white people died because they were denied access. For about a month during the pandemic, Minnesota did factor race into a scoring system to prioritize referrals for the treatments. A case study after the state’s program ended shows that at least 79% of patients who received referrals were white, in line with the racial composition of the state’s population. People who were clinically eligible for the treatments weren’t denied access, but received referrals after higher-risk patients received theirs. By early 2022, when monoclonal antibody supplies were lowest and Minnesota used a weighted lottery system, race had been removed as a scoring factor. We rate the claim Mostly False.

In an Aug. 11 interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, Vance tempered his connection to Project 2025 and called Roberts a friend — a word Roberts has also used to describe Vance. ""Project 2025 is not affiliated with the Trump campaign,"" Vance said. ""Kevin Roberts is a friend of mine, but I wouldn’t say that he speaks for the president in the same way I wouldn’t say that he speaks for me."" The Associated Press on July 30 shared an excerpt of an advance copy of Vance’s foreword that read, ""Never before has a figure with Roberts’s depth and stature within the American Right tried to articulate a genuinely new future for conservatism. The Heritage Foundation isn’t some random outpost on Capitol Hill; it is and has been the most influential engine of ideas for Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump."" The New Republic reported July 30 that it also obtained a copy of the foreword, which it reprinted on its website. There is no mention of Project 2025 in the excerpt attributed to Vance. It contains the passage shared by the AP and goes on to liken ""modern liberalism"" to ""a well-meaning gardener"" who treats a garden with chemicals, killing both weeds and ""many of the good things."" A modern conservative movement, the excerpt said, needs to recultivate the garden: ""The old conservative movement argued if you just got government out of the way, natural forces would resolve problems—we are no longer in this situation and must take a different approach. As Kevin Roberts writes, ‘It’s fine to take a laissez-faire approach when you are in the safety of the sunshine. But when the twilight descends and you hear the wolves, you’ve got to circle the wagons and load the muskets.’"" A Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson pointed us to evidence including Vance’s July 19 X post, as well as book readings and speeches Vance has participated in at the Heritage Foundation. When we asked Vance’s team about Walz’s claim, the campaign responded with an Aug. 9 statement from spokesperson William Martin reiterating that Vance ""has previously said that he has no involvement with (Project 2025) and has plenty of disagreements with what they're calling for."" Our ruling Walz said Vance ""literally wrote the foreword for the architect of the Project 2025 agenda."" Vance wrote the forward for a book authored by Roberts, the Heritage Foundation’s president and a Project 2025 leader. We rate this claim True. "
"August 13, 2024",Jesse Watters,Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz “forced schools to stock tampons in boys’ bathrooms.”,barely-true,"In 2023, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed a law that requires schools provide access to menstrual products in bathrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12. The law does not distinguish by sex or gender, saying period products ""must be available to all menstruating students."" A legal expert from Period Law, a group that advocates for making menstrual products free, said the bill would allow schools to provide period products in boys’ bathrooms, but it does not mandate the products be provided there. A school that provides products in girls’ rooms and all gender bathrooms, for example, would be in compliance.","""Tampon Tim."" Allies of former President Donald Trump coined this nickname for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz the same day Vice President Kamala Harris tapped him to be her running mate. ""He’s sick,"" Fox News host Jesse Watters said on his Aug. 6 show, hours after Harris’ announcement. ""Walz forced schools to stock tampons in boys’ bathrooms. Tampons in fourth grade boys’ bathrooms. What a freak. What do boys need tampons for? This guy is not Minnesota nice. He’s Minnesota nuts."" (Internet Archive) The narrative quickly spread across conservative social media . Fox News host Sean Hannity , Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Newsmax host Greg Kelly made similar claims A Fox News spokesperson pointed PolitiFact to a law requiring schools to provide access to free menstrual products for all students in grades 4 through 12. But the claim about schools being ""forced"" to provide period products in boys’ bathrooms exaggerates the law’s requirements and reveals a lack of understanding of both the law and its practical application. The Minnesota state Legislature passed the provision in May 2023 as part of a larger education bill that passed 35-32 in the Senate and 70-62 in the House. Walz signed it into law May 24, 2023. Democrats, who had a majority in both chambers , championed the bill; one Republican state senator voted in its favor. Students had advocated for the law for years. We contacted Walz and Minnesota’s Department of Education with questions about the law’s goals, interpretation and implementation. We received no response from Walz, and no specific answers from the Education Department, whose spokesperson reiterated the text of the statute. What does this Minnesota law require of schools? The law, which took effect Jan. 1, requires schools to provide access to menstrual products such as pads, tampons or other similar period products, ""in restrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12 according to a plan developed by the school district."" As adopted, the law does not distinguish by sex or gender. It says the products ""must be available to all menstruating students."" This means transgender boys and nonbinary students — who might menstruate and are permitted to use boys’ restrooms — must also have access to the menstrual products. That does not mean menstrual products must be stocked in boys’ restrooms, legal experts told PolitiFact. ""As written the law does not require products to be put in men’s restrooms,"" said Lacey Gero, director of government relations at the Alliance for Period Supplies , a nonprofit organization. ""The law leaves it up to the local school districts to create a plan for providing products in restrooms, but does not specify which restrooms."" Some states with similar laws specify that period products should be provided only in girls’ restrooms, said Suzanne Herman, a lawyer and legal director at Period Law , a legal group that advocates making menstrual products free. Minnesota does not. ""It’s more inclusive than other laws, but it certainly doesn’t mandate that they be in all boys’ restrooms,"" Herman said of Minnesota’s law. For example, the law would allow a school administrator who knows there are trans or nonbinary students who only use the boys’ restrooms to provide menstrual products in those bathrooms, she said. ""But they don’t have to,"" Herman said. ""They could just put (the products) in the unisex ones."" Herman, who has been reviewing states’ laws that require schools to provide menstrual products, said the Minnesota’s law’s wording leads her to believe that, in practice, period products ""are probably in all girls’ bathrooms and unisex ones."" Republicans tried to amend the Minnesota law so it would require providing menstrual products only in restrooms regularly used by ""female students"" , but the proposed change failed to win enough support. When the law passed in May 2023, Minnesota became the 16th state to require that schools provide free menstrual products, said Sarah Howard, vice president of marketing at Aunt Flow , a company committed to ensuring access to period products. Herman said that these state laws typically start either in fourth or sixth grade, and the states that provide products to students as early as fourth grade help include students who start menstruating at an early age. Students advocated for free menstrual products to help address ""period poverty,"" MPR News, Minnesota’s public radio station, reported. Period poverty refers to insufficient access to the menstrual products, education and sanitation facilities that would allow people to manage their menstrual health. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former teacher, delivers his third State of the State address, March 28, 2021, from his old classroom at Mankato West High School in Mankato, Minn. (Glen Stubbe/Star Tribune via AP) It’s unclear exactly how many Minnesota public school students grades 4 to 12 are transgender or nonbinary, but by the best available data, the number is small. A 2022 report by the Williams Institute, a public policy research institute at the UCLA School of Law, found that about 0.94% of Minnesota’s 13-17 age group was trans, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from 2017 to 2020. And nationally, among adults, 2022 survey data found that from 0.5% to 1.6% of U.S. adults are transgender or nonbinary. Meanwhile, 2023 aggregated data from Gallup found 0.9% of U.S. adults reported that they were transgender. Some districts, such as Minneapolis Public Schools, require schools to provide improved bathroom access for transgender and nonbinary students, including more accessible all-gender bathrooms, MinnPost, a local news organization, reported . The Minnesota Department of Education said it wasn’t tracking school districts’ implementation of the laws, and we were unable to determine how each district has done this. In an Aug. 8 editorial , the Star Tribune reported that a spokesperson for Anoka-Hennepin schools, the state’s largest school district, said free menstrual products aren’t found in male-only bathrooms, but they are provided in nongendered bathrooms, girls’ bathrooms or from health staff. Searching the Nexis news database, we found no reports that menstrual products are being provided currently in boys’ restrooms in any Minnesota school district. Our ruling Watters said, ""Walz forced schools to stock tampons in boys’ bathrooms."" In 2023, Walz signed a law requiring schools provide access to menstrual products in bathrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12, according to a plan school districts will create. The law requires ""all menstruating students"" have access to the products. Legal experts said a school would be compliant if it provided period products only in girls’ bathrooms and unisex or all-gender bathrooms, for example. Although conditions could exist under which a school might be required to stock menstrual products in a restroom traditionally used exclusively by boys, we found no reports that schools were regularly doing so. Surveys show that transgender and nonbinary people make up less than 2% of adults in the U.S. and an analysis of Minnesota transgender youth ages 13-17 put the figure at less than 1%. Legal experts said the law, which Watters pointed to as proof of his claim, does not specify that tampons must be provided in boys’ bathrooms. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.  "

"August 12, 2024",JD Vance,"Says Tim Walz said he carried weapons in war, but “he has not spent a day in a combat zone.”",true,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a 2018 video the Kamala Harris campaign circulated on social media in August, said he wanted to get ""weapons of war that I carried in war"" off the streets. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, winning honors for sharpshooting and weapons training, but he has acknowledged he didn’t see combat duty. A Walz spokesperson said the governor misspoke.","Republicans have been attacking Democratic vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s military service, something that traditionally registers as a strength for politicians. After Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign shared a 2018 video clip of Walz discussing gun control, Republicans pounced on the governor’s statement about weapons that he said he carried in war. In the clip, Walz said, ""We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at."" Former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who, like Walz, is a military veteran, took the governor to task for his comment at an Aug. 7 campaign stop in Shelby Township, Michigan. ""He said, and he was making a point about gun control, that ‘we shouldn’t allow weapons that I used in war to be on America’s streets.’ Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?"" Vance said. ""What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone."" We rated Vance’s comment about Walz abandoning his unit Mostly False . The Iraq War was a protracted conflict that spanned 2003 to 2011. During the early years of the war, Walz, who served 24 years in the Army National Guard, eyed retirement and a political career. He submitted retirement paperwork five to seven months before retiring in May 2005 to run for Congress. As he awaited his retirement paperwork’s processing, Walz filed paperwork to run for Congress in February 2005, a month before his battalion received a March notification for a potential deployment to Iraq within two years. Walz’s battalion was officially ordered to deploy to Iraq in July 2005, two months after Walz retired. But was what Vance said about Walz not carrying weapons in combat accurate? Walz first enlisted in the Nebraska National Guard in 1981 days after he turned 17. He transferred to the Minnesota National Guard in 1996, where he served in the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery until he retired in May 2005. The Associated Press reported that Walz was a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard in 1985 when he attended the University of Houston, and that he also served as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard. Walz spent months on active duty deployed overseas, but didn’t serve in Iraq or Afghanistan. He and his battalion deployed to Italy in August 2003 to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom. He returned to Minnesota in April 2004, a Minnesota National Guard spokesperson told PolitiFact. In an email, Lauren Hitt, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson, told PolitiFact that Walz thanked Vance for his service and ""misspoke"" in the 2018 video. ""In making the case for why weapons of war should never be on our streets or in our classrooms, the Governor misspoke,"" Hitt said. ""He did handle weapons of war and believes strongly that only military members trained to carry those deadly weapons should have access to them, unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance who prioritize the gun lobby over our children."" Luke Schroeder, a Trump-Vance campaign spokesperson, said Walz ""absolutely said this, that’s not in dispute,"" pointing to the video the Harris campaign shared on X. Schroeder also pointed to several news articles about Walz’s military service that showed he didn’t see combat duty. Minnesota Public Radio reported in 2018 that in his military career, Walz responded to weather disasters such as floods and tornadoes, and spent months deployed overseas. He specialized in heavy artillery and won ribbons for his proficiency in sharpshooting and hand grenades, the outlet wrote , citing military records. He never saw combat, Minnesota Public Radio reported. ""I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,"" Walz told the news outlet. ""I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else."" Vance served as a combat correspondent, working in public affairs for the U.S. Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007 and deployed to Iraq for six months in 2005. He did not experience combat , meaning he did not carry weapons on a battlefield. Our ruling Vance said that Walz said he carried weapons in war, but ""he has not spent a day in a combat zone."" Although Walz used weapons and trained colleagues to use them during his long military career, his 2018 statement implied that he carried weapons on a battlefield, which he did not. Walz misspoke, his campaign said. We rate Vance’s statement True.  "

"August 9, 2024",Donald Trump,"Says his Jan. 6, 2021, speech on the White House Ellipse drew the “same number of people,” as the 1963 March on Washington where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I Have a Dream” speech.",false,"The House select committee that investigated the events of Jan. 6, 2021, estimated 53,000 people attended President Donald Trump’s speech at the White House Ellipse. The National Archives says 250,000 people attended Martin Luther King's Jr.’s ""I Have a Dream"" speech on Aug. 28, 1963, during the March on Washington.","On Jan. 6, 2021, then-President Donald Trump told a crowd of supporters to ""fight"" and walk to the U.S. Capitol to pressure leaders not to certify Joe Biden’s presidential election victory. His speech preceded a violent assault on the Capitol. Almost six decades earlier, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his landmark ""I Have a Dream"" speech from the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom that called for racial harmony and civil rights for Black Americans. Now, Trump says the two Washington, D.C., speeches share something else in common: crowd size. During his Aug. 8 Mar-a-Lago press conference that touched on myriad topics, Trump claimed there was a ""peaceful transfer"" of power when he left office in 2021. Biden was sworn in as president under heavy security, but the effort to stop the counting of electoral votes two weeks before was unprecedented and brutal . When a reporter challenged Trump’s ""peaceful transfer"" framing, Trump answered that ""nobody was killed on Jan. 6,"" which is also wrong . Trump then pivoted to his own remarks to supporters that day on the White House Ellipse, which is on the South Lawn, facing the Washington Monument. ""And, you know, it's very interesting, the biggest crowd I've ever spoken to, and I said ‘peacefully and patriotically,’ which nobody wants to say,"" Trump said. (Trump also told the crowd on the Ellipse to ""fight."") Then he said: ""The biggest crowd I've ever spoken to, and you've seen Maggie (Haberman, a New York Times reporter), I was in at the mall. I was at the Washington Monument. I was at the whole thing. I had crowds. I don't know who's ever had a bigger crowd than I have, but I had it many times. The biggest crowd I've ever spoken before was that day, and I'll tell you, it's very hard to find a picture of that crowd. You see the picture of a small number of people, relatively, going to the Capitol, but you never see the picture of the crowd. ""The biggest crowd I've ever spoken. I've spoken to the biggest crowds, nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me. If you look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate, same everything — same number of people, if not, we had more. And they said he had a million people, but I had 25,000 people. But when you look at the exact same picture, and everything's the same, because it was the fountains, the whole thing — all the way back from Lincoln to Washington. And you look at it, and you look at the picture of his crowd, my crowd, we actually had more people. They said I had 25,000 and he had a million people, and I'm OK with it because I like Dr. Martin Luther King."" A PolitiFact reader asked us to fact-check Trump’s comparison with King’s ""I Have a Dream"" speech during the 1963 March on Washington. The evidence shows Trump’s Ellipse speech was much smaller than the packed National Mall for King’s address . A close listener might pick up that Trump offered imagery about the location that doesn’t line up with Trump’s Jan. 6 ""Save America"" rally, such as that it happened on ""the mall,"" and stretched ""from Lincoln to Washington."" Those details line up with the Trump administration’s July 4, 2019, ""Salute to America,"" which attracted a larger crowd to the mall. Trump may have conflated the events, and the Trump campaign did not respond to our requests to clarify. In recent years, government agencies have not wanted to validate or debunk turnout for political events. (Trump’s first press secretary made the ridiculously false claim that Trump’s 2017 inauguration drew the biggest inauguration crowd ever.) So, recent estimates, if they are made at all, tend to come from media outlets, sometimes with the assistance of experts using aerial photography and mathematical formulas. King’s speech drew 200,000 to 250,000 people The 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom was a planned, peaceful display of unity among several organizations and grassroots activists that had been fighting for civil rights through boycotts and marches. The event included many celebrities and musicians and multiple speeches in addition to King’s speech. The crowd stretched from the Lincoln Memorial, past the Reflecting Pool and toward the Washington Monument. Here is an image of the crowd during King’s speech: A crowd near the Reflecting Pool listens to Martin Luther King Jr. and other speakers during the March on Washington in 1963. (U.S. Information Agency, Press and Publications Service, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons) The National Archives says 250,000 people attended the March on Washington during King’s speech. The U.S. Census Bureau uses a somewhat smaller number of ""more than 200,000."" The NAACP said that the rally drew over ""260,000"" people from across the country. The Ellipse crowd on Jan. 6 was smaller Trump had repeatedly encouraged his supporters the month before his speech at the Ellipse around noon on Jan. 6 to come for a ""big protest"" in Washington. By the time Trump finished his speech, crowds had started to gather outside the Capitol. Estimates are fairly loose, but none exceed King’s turnout. The New York Times reported that ""tens of thousands"" of Trump supporters gathered for the rally. The Washington Post said ""thousands"" had assembled at the Ellipse for the speech. The House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack put the crowd number at 53,000 , or at most a quarter of the generally accepted size of the crowd during King’s speech. ""From a tent backstage at the Ellipse, President Trump looked out at the crowd of approximately 53,000 supporters and became enraged,"" the House committee found . ""Just under half of those gathered — a sizeable stretch of about 25,000 people — refused to walk through the magnetometers and be screened for weapons, leaving the venue looking half-empty to the television audience at home."" The day after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot, U.S. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told The Associated Press that law enforcement’s estimates of the overall crowd size in the protests ""were all over the board"" from as low as ""2,000 to as many as 80,000."" We found several photos from that day, including one Reuters wide-shot image that features the Washington Monument in the background. With the Washington Monument in the background, people attend a rally in support of former President Donald Trump on Jan. 6, 2021. (AP) The question that triggered Trump’s crowd-size answer was about Jan. 6, and Trump called it ""the biggest crowd I’ve ever spoken to."" But some of the things he said — such as ""the exact same picture"" and ""from Lincoln to Washington"" — correlate with features of a different Trump speech on July 4, 2019. The 2019 ""Salute to America"" event, which draws hundreds of thousands of people each year, honored the military’s branches and featured a military flyover and fireworks. On the Capitol side, many came to hear singer Carole King and Trump was the first president in nearly 70 years to add a speech onto the event.

(Credit: The White House, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons) Steve Doig, a professor at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication who has studied crowd size estimates, told PolitiFact that, the photos show the crowd stretching from the Lincoln Memorial to the end of the Reflecting Pool, but give no hint of how far the crowd extends beyond the trees that line the pool. We were not able to find crowd estimates from the 2019 event. Our ruling Describing his speech to supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump said he spoke to the ""same number of people, if not, we had more"" than King’s 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech. The crowd-size comparison is wrong. Credible estimates say many more people attended the 1963 March on Washington during King’s speech than attended Trump’s Ellipse speech. We rate the comparison False.  "

Este proyecto de ley amplió el acceso a las licencias de conducir a las personas del estado, independientemente de su estatus migratorio. Los demócratas de la Cámara de Representantes y del Senado apoyaron ampliamente la medida. Sólo un republicano de la Cámara de Representantes la respaldó. Esta ley revocó una orden de 2003 del exgobernador republicano Tim Pawlenty que prohibía al estado proveer licencias a personas en el país ilegalmente. Walz dijo en marzo de 2023 que la ley haría las carreteras más seguras y que él era ""partidario de este proyecto de ley desde hace mucho tiempo"". ""Garantizar que los conductores en nuestro estado tengan licencia y lleven seguro hace que las carreteras sean más seguras para todos los minnesotanos"", dijo Walz. PolitiFact contactó a la oficina de Donalds, pero no obtuvo respuesta. La campaña de Harris-Walz no hizo comentarios. La oficina del gobernador de Minnesota tampoco respondió. El Migration Policy Institute calcula que unas 81,000 personas viven ilegalmente en Minnesota. La población de Minnesota es de unos 5.7 millones de habitantes. Ley de 2023 La ley entró en vigor el 1 de octubre de 2023. Esta permite a los inmigrantes que carecen de estatus legal en EE.UU. obtener una licencia de conducir estándar o tarjeta de identificación de Minnesota.

"August 9, 2024",Tim Walz,"""El crimen violento aumentó bajo Donald Trump"".",half-true,"Si ves algo que te hace preguntar: ¿es cierto? Mándanoslo por WhatsApp y nuestro equipo lo investigará, (813) 260-7595. ¡Sigue nuestro canal en WhatsApp!","En un momento de su presentación como candidato demócrata a la vicepresidencia, el gobernador de Minnesota, Tim Walz, lanzó una crítica al ex presidente Donald Trump sobre el crimen. ""No se equivoquen"", dijo Walz en el mitin del 6 de agosto de 2024 en Filadelfia con la candidata presidencial demócrata, Kamala Harris. ""El crimen violento aumentó bajo Donald Trump. Y eso sin contar los delitos que él cometió"". La última parte de la declaración de Walz se refería a la condena de Trump en mayo de 2024 por 34 cargos de falsificación de registros comerciales en un esquema para encubrir un pago de dinero secreto a la actriz porno Stormy Daniels previo a las elecciones presidenciales de 2016. Pero, qué hay de la afirmación de Walz de que ""el crimen violento aumentó bajo Donald Trump"", que Walz repitió en un discurso el 7 de agosto en Eau Claire, Wisconsin. La afirmación del recién nombrado candidato a la vicepresidencia necesita contexto y algunas aclaraciones. Tasas de crímenes violentos durante la presidencia de Trump La definición de crimen violento del Buró Federal de Investigaciones de Estados Unidos (FBI, por sus siglas en inglés) incluye cuatro tipos de delitos: homicidio, violación, robo y asalto agravado. La tasa de crímenes violentos en Estados Unidos aumentó durante las décadas de 1970 y 1980, alcanzando su pico en 1991 y disminuyendo desde entonces, con algunos repuntes periódicos. Durante los primeros tres años de la presidencia de Trump, la tasa de crímenes violentos por cada 100,000 habitantes — la métrica a la que nos remitió la campaña de Harris-Walz, cuando pidió información — cayó cada año. Pasó de 377.7 crímenes violentos por cada 100,000 habitantes en 2017 a 373.4 en 2018 y a 363.9 en 2019. Sin embargo, en 2020, la tasa de crímenes violentos se disparó a 385.2 por cada 100,000 personas, más alta que cualquier año anterior bajo la presidencia de Trump. @politifactenespanol ¡Sigue el canal de WhatsApp de PolitiFact en Español para estar al día de lo que es cierto, falso, engañoso o fuera de contexto! #whatsapp #canales #verificacion #factcheck ♬ Querulous Shred - DJ BAI El crimen violento disminuyó durante los primeros tres años de Donald Trump en el cargo, luego se disparó en su cuarto año, 2020 El repunte en 2020 fue especialmente pronunciado en el caso de los homicidios. En 2020, el número de homicidios en Estados Unidos reportados al FBI aumentó en 5,795, pasando de 16,619 en 2019 a 22,414 en 2020. En cualquier año anterior desde 1961, el número de homicidios nunca había aumentado en más de 2,000 en un año, lo que significa que el aumento de 2020 fue casi el triple del récord anterior. Sin embargo, incluso considerando el repunte de 2020, la tasa de crímenes violentos en el último año de Trump fue aún más baja que en el último año de su predecesor, el presidente demócrata Barack Obama. En 2016, la tasa de crímenes violentos fue de 389.9 por cada 100,000 habitantes, un poco más alta que la tasa de 2020. Otro contexto importante: el nivel máximo de crímenes violentos en 2020 representaba una tasa mucho más baja que la de hace unas décadas. En 2020, hubo 385.2 crímenes violentos por cada 100,000 habitantes. En contraste, la tasa nunca bajó de 500 entre 1979 y 2001, y alcanzó su punto máximo de 758.2 en 1991. ¿Por qué aumentó el crimen violento en 2020? Culpar exclusivamente a Trump por el aumento de homicidios en 2020 ignora lo inusual que fue la vida en Estados Unidos (y el mundo entero) ese año. A partir de marzo de 2020 , el país fue golpeado rápida y severamente por la pandemia de coronavirus. Esto desestabilizó la economía, cambió los hábitos de viaje colectivos, llevó a muchas personas a quedarse en casa y dejó temporalmente a muchos estadounidenses sin empleo ni ingresos. Otro factor inusual ese año fue el asesinato de George Floyd por parte de la policía de Minneapolis. La muerte de Floyd provocó un clamor nacional y una reflexión sobre los problemas raciales. ""Señalaría los cambios en las actitudes hacia la policía y la legitimidad de la policía, así como la retirada policial después de la muerte de Floyd como factores potencialmente primarios detrás del aumento"", Jeff Asher, analista de la empresa de consultoría AH Datalytics, que se especializa en datos sobre criminalidad le dijo a PolitiFact en junio. ""Hay evidencia de que el aumento en el porte de armas de fuego en los meses posteriores a la pandemia podría haber actuado como un acelerante, inflando aún más el aumento"", agregó Asher. El CEO del Consejo de Justicia Criminal, Adam Gelb, ha calificado el entorno de 2020 como ""una clase magistral en criminología"", dado su inicio repentino, su duración y su impacto dramático en las personas e instituciones. Lo más probable es que todos estos factores se combinaran y se alimentaran entre sí. ""No es posible desentrañar cada factor de la pandemia"", dijo Asher. En 2021, durante el primer año en el cargo del presidente Joe Biden, la tasa de homicidios se mantuvo alta; los homicidios aumentaron en 122 ese año en comparación con 2020. Desde entonces, han disminuido, y aunque los datos actuales tienen un retraso de más de un año, las estimaciones indican que la tasa de homicidios está en camino de regresar a su nivel prepandémico. Nuestro veredicto Walz dijo, ""El crimen violento aumentó bajo Donald Trump"". Después de disminuir durante los primeros tres años de la presidencia de Trump, el aumento de la tasa de crímenes violentos en 2020 (su último año del republicano en el cargo) fue lo suficientemente grande como para borrar las disminuciones de los años anteriores de su mandato. Sin embargo, la tasa de crímenes violentos en el último año de Trump fue aún ligeramente más baja que en el último año de su predecesor, Barack Obama. Los expertos nos dijeron que es incorrecto culpar exclusivamente a Trump por el aumento de la criminalidad. El repunte fue causado por una confluencia de la pandemia de coronavirus y el trastorno social tras el asesinato de Floyd por la policía. Calificamos esta declaración como Medio Cierta.

"August 9, 2024",JD Vance,"“When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.”",barely-true,"Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz served in the Nebraska and Minnesota National Guards for 24 years. Walz has said he retired in May 2005 to run for Congress; he submitted retirement paperwork five to seven months beforehand. After Walz filed candidacy paperwork in February 2005, his battalion received a March 2005 notification for a potential — not definite — deployment within two years, not immediately. Walz’s battalion was not officially ordered to go to Iraq until July 2005, two months after Walz retired.","Republican vice presidential nominee and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance sought to negatively frame the 24-year military career of newly minted Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, Minnesota’s current governor. ""When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America, asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,"" Vance said Aug. 7 at the Shelby, Michigan, police department. Vance served as a combat correspondent for the U.S. Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007 and deployed to Iraq for six months in 2005 but did not experience combat . Vance continued, ""When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. … I think it’s shameful."" At a different event, Vance used the phrase "" stolen valor "" to describe his accusations against Walz. On X, Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, made a claim similar to Vance’s, writing, ""Tim Walz TURNED HIS BACK on the soldiers in his unit because he was TOO afraid to deploy to Iraq!!"" Walz retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005. He had submitted retirement paperwork five to seven months beforehand, Fox News reported , citing the Minnesota National Guard. In March 2005, Walz’s battalion had been notified about a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz’s congressional campaign said in a news release that month, citing the National Guard Public Affairs Office. The Minnesota National Guard said the battalion then received an official order about mobilizing for deployment to Iraq in July 2005, after Walz retired. Vance’s statement misleads by distorting the timeline. Walz had not been ""asked by his country to go to Iraq,"" as Vance said. He had been given a two-year window for a potential, not definite, deployment. And the official deployment notice came after Walz’s retirement. Walz has said since before his Army retirement that he left to run for Congress. He filed his candidacy paperwork in February 2005, before the March 2005 notification about the potential deployment. This is not a new line of attack. When Walz ran for a second term as Minnesota governor in 2022, his Republican opponent, who did not serve in the U.S. military, criticized Walz for leaving the National Guard before his unit deployed to Iraq. Two retired Minnesota National Guard command sergeant majors also penned a paid letter to a Minnesota newspaper in 2018 claiming Walz ""embellished and selectively omitted facts"" about his military service. This letter resurfaced on X after Vice President Kamala Harris tapped Walz as her running mate. Other guard members who served with Walz have defended him. Walz’s spokesperson in the Minnesota governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment, and the Harris-Walz campaign declined to comment. When reached by The New York Times , a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson didn’t provide new details about Walz’s retirement timeline and instead highlighted Walz’s record advocating for veterans and their families. When contacted for comment, Vance’s campaign spokesperson sent links to the 2005 Walz campaign news release about the potential deployment and several news stories that quote former members of Walz’s battalion who were upset with him for not deploying to Iraq. Walz’s military timeline Walz enlisted in the Nebraska National Guard on April 8, 1981, two days after his 17th birthday. In 1996, Walz transferred to the Minnesota National Guard, where he served in the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery until he retired May 16, 2005, Army Lt. Col. Kristen Augé, Minnesota National Guard’s state public affairs officer, told PolitiFact in a statement. During his service, Walz responded to floods and tornadoes, specialized in heavy artillery and was recognized for his proficiency in sharpshooting and hand grenades, Minnesota Public Radio reported . On Aug. 3, 2003, Walz and his battalion were deployed to Italy to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom. Walz returned to Minnesota in April 2004, Augé said. In May 2005, Walz, then 41, officially retired from the Minnesota National Guard to campaign for Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District. He filed his statement of candidacy paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 10, 2005. Walz was elected to Congress in November 2006. Al Bonnifield, who served with Walz in the Minnesota National Guard, told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018 that Walz weighed his retirement from the guard and congressional run ""very heavy."" Bonnifield reiterated this to The Washington Post on Aug. 7. ""Would the soldier look down on him because he didn’t go with us? Would the common soldier say, ‘Hey, he didn't go with us, he’s trying to skip out on a deployment?’ And he wasn’t,"" Bonnifield said in 2018. Doug Julin, who served as a more senior command sergeant major in Walz’s battalion, said Walz went over his head to get retirement approval before the unit’s deployment was official, because Julin would have ""analyzed it and challenged him,"" the New York Post reported Aug. 8. Others who served in Walz’s battalion have said he ""ditched"" them and his actions were ""dishonorable,"" Fox News reported . Battalion’s deployment to Iraq Walz’s unit received an ""alert order"" for mobilization to Iraq on July 14, 2005, Army Lt. Col. Ryan Rossman, Minnesota National Guard’s director of operations, told PolitiFact in a statement. The unit received the official Department of the Army mobilization order Aug. 14, 2005, and mobilized Oct. 12, 2005, Rossman said. The unit deployed to Iraq in March 2006 and was deployed for 19 months, according to an October 2007 congressional resolution . The two retired Minnesota National Guard command sergeant majors who wrote the 2018 letter said the battalion received a ""warning order"" in early 2005 ""to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq."" They did not specify the warning letter’s date. Augé of the Minnesota National Guard told PolitiFact the agency doesn’t have information about any unofficial orders that might have been sent to the battalion. An archived March 20, 2005, press release from Walz’s congressional campaign website said the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced March 17, 2005, ""a possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard."" The announcement said a portion of Walz’s battalion could be mobilized to serve in Iraq within the next two years. Walz said in his campaign’s press release, ""As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington, D.C., or in Iraq. I don't want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race."" Although Walz had been promoted in 2004 to command sergeant major, he retired in 2005 as a master sergeant, one rank below command sergeant major, ""for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,"" Augé said. Joseph Eustice, a 32-year military veteran who served in and led the same guard unit as Walz, told The New York Times and NewsNation in Aug. 7 interviews that when Walz decided to retire in May 2005, their unit had heard rumors of a potential deployment to Iraq, but had not received official orders. Our ruling Vance said, ""When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him."" Vance’s statement ignores that Walz’s unit was not officially ordered to go to Iraq until July 2005, two months after Walz officially retired. After 24 years of military service, Walz said he retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005 to run for Congress. He had submitted retirement paperwork five to seven months beforehand. He filed candidacy paperwork in February 2005. There’s an element of truth in Vance’s statement because in March 2005, before Walz officially retired, his battalion was notified of possible deployment to Iraq within two years. Walz was aware at the time of his retirement that deployment could be possible and one of his fellow guard members described Walz’s retirement decision as ""very heavy."" But the March 2005 notification gave a time frame of two years for a possible — not definite — deployment that would not occur immediately, which is the way Vance’s statement framed it. At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the speaker, Vance, who did not provide details to support his statement. We rate it Mostly False.

"• August 7,",Donald Trump,"In negotiating releases of Americans held abroad, “(I) gave the opposing country NOTHING — and never any cash.”",barely-true,"Former President Donald Trump’s administration released prisoners held by the U.S. government in exchange for freeing Americans held abroad. In 2017, the Trump administration agreed to pay $2 million to North Korea for the release of a U.S. citizen detained there, but a White House official said the money was never paid.","After a historic prisoner swap Aug. 1 among the U.S., Russia and other countries, former President Donald Trump questioned the details and compared it with deals he made during his presidency. ""So when are they going to release the details of the prisoner swap with Russia? How many people do we get versus them? Are we also paying them cash?"" Trump wrote Aug. 1 on Truth Social . ""I got back many hostages, and gave the opposing Country NOTHING — and never any cash. To do so is bad precedent for the future."" Three American citizens were among the released : U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who was imprisoned in Russia for almost six years; Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who had been imprisoned in Russia for more than a year; and Alsu Kurmasheva, a Radio Liberty journalist detained in October 2023. In exchange for the prisoners held in Russia, the U.S. and other countries released eight prisoners , including Vadim Krasikov , who was serving a lifetime sentence in Germany for murder. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. did not exchange money in the deal. Trump’s administration released prisoners held by the U.S. government in exchange for having other nations free Americans held abroad. ""There is ALWAYS a quid pro quo in hostage diplomacy, as this issue is known,"" said Anthony Wanis-St. John, an American University associate professor of peace, human rights and cultural relations who specializes in conflict zone negotiations. ""It can be material, it can be a reciprocal release, or a political concession that is kept secret or is symbolic."" Here are some examples of prisoner exchanges and their terms during Trump’s administration. One U.S. citizen held in Iran exchanged for one Iranian in 2019 In 2019, the U.S. secured the release of Xiyue Wang, a U.S. citizen who had been held prisoner in Iran since 2016. Wang was a Princeton University graduate student conducting doctoral research when he was arrested in Tehran and imprisoned on espionage charges. In exchange for Wang’s freedom, the U.S. agreed to release Masoud Soleimani, an Iranian scientist who was arrested and charged with violating American trade sanctions against Iran. The Justice Department had dropped the charges and Soleimani was expected to be released from prison before the exchange took place, The New York Times reported . One U.S. veteran held in Iran released for one Iranian American doctor in 2020 In 2020, the Trump administration negotiated the release of Michael White, a U.S. Navy veteran who was imprisoned in 2018 after traveling to Iran to visit a woman he met online. White was serving a 10-year sentence after Iranian authorities convicted him of insulting Iran’s supreme leader and posting private information online, The Associated Press reported . As part of this deal, the U.S. agreed to release Matteo Taerri, also known as Majid Taheri, an Iranian American doctor who had violated U.S. sanctions on Iran. Taerri pleaded guilty and served several months in jail before he was released on bond. The Justice Department dropped its charges against Taerri. Two Americans held in Yemen released for more than 200 Houthi militants in 2020 On Oct. 14, 2020, the Trump administration secured the release of two Americans whom Houthi rebels in Yemen had held captive: Sandra Loli and Mikael Gidada. The remains of Bilal Fateen, an American who died in captivity, were repatriated. In exchange, more than 200 Houthi militants returned from Oman to Yemen, according to news reports . The Trump administration did not link the two returns as an exchange, but The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. and Saudi Arabian officials confirmed it was. ""We extend our sincerest thanks to Sultan Haitham bin Tariq of Oman and King Salman of Saudi Arabia for their efforts to secure the release of our citizens,"" National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said then . U.S. agreed in 2017 to pay $2 million for U.S. citizen held in North Korea, but didn’t send the money In June 2017, a medical team and a State Department representative returned University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier to the U.S., after he had been detained in North Korea for more than 17 months. Warmbier was in a coma , and a few days later, he died . On April 25, 2019, The Washington Post reported that North Korea billed the U.S. $2 million to cover Warmbier’s hospital care. The U.S. envoy sent to retrieve Warmbier signed an agreement to pay the bill under Trump’s orders, the Post reported. ""We did not pay money for our great Otto. There was no money paid. There was a fake news report that money was paid,"" Trump said April 26, 2019. But on April 28, 2019, White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that ""it appears"" North Korea did demand money from the U.S. He said ""that is what I’m told"" when asked whether the U.S. envoy signed a document agreeing to pay the money to get Warmbier back. However, Bolton, who was not working in the Trump administration at the time of Warmbier’s release, said the U.S. ""absolutely"" did not pay North Korea any money for the release. Our ruling Trump said in hostage releases, ""(I) gave the opposing country NOTHING — and never any cash."" Multiple times during Trump’s administration, the U.S. government released prisoners it held in exchange for freeing Americans held abroad. In one instance, the U.S. agreed to pay money to North Korea for the release of a U.S. citizen, but a White House official said the money was never sent. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth because he never gave cash in exchange for Americans’ release. However, the statement ignores critical facts about the terms the U.S. agreed to in these exchanges. We rate the statement Mostly False. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.

"August 7, 2024",Donald Trump,"During the 2020 Minnesota riots after George Floyd’s murder, Gov. Tim Walz didn’t call in the National Guard, “so, I sent in the National Guard to save Minneapolis.”",false,"Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order May 28, 2020, calling up the Minnesota National Guard to respond to riots. Shortly after the order, the National Guard said that it was assigning and preparing units to respond. President Donald Trump spoke to Walz hours after Walz’s order. Trump offered assistance.","Former President Donald Trump said during a recent Minnesota rally that it was he — not Gov. Tim Walz — who ordered the National Guard to respond to Minneapolis riots in 2020. ""Every voter in Minnesota needs to know that when the violent mobs of anarchists and looters and Marxists came to burn down Minneapolis four years ago, remember me?"" Trump said at his July 27 St. Cloud rally . ""I couldn't get your governor to act. He's supposed to call in the National Guard or the Army and he didn't do it. I couldn't get your governor. So, I sent in the National Guard to save Minneapolis."" CNN and WCCO-TV News , a CBS affiliate in Minnesota, debunked a similar Trump statement in 2020. We found that Walz called in the National Guard hours before Trump contacted him, but Walz has faced criticism about his response’s timing. Walz sent in the National Guard George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, 2020. Protests — some peaceful and some violent — erupted soon after video of his death went viral. The Harris-Walz campaign did not respond on the record to our request for information. Walz’s governor’s office also did not respond to PolitiFact’s email asking about Trump’s claim. However, Walz spokesperson Teddy Tschann wrote in a statement to CNN in 2020 that Walz ""activated the Minnesota National Guard at the request of the Mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, before he talked to the White House."" Tschann told CNN that Walz was in touch with Trump administration officials during the unrest, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman U.S. Army Gen. Mark Milley. But Walz was the one who put forward the plans for the use of the guard, he said. WCCO-TV wrote a timeline of Walz’s 2020 actions . At 4:04 p.m. CST May 28 in Minnesota, Walz issued an executive order activating the Minnesota National Guard to allow for personnel and equipment to support emergency operations. Walz wrote that ""feelings of anguish, anger, and disillusionment are justified,"" however, people engaged in ""unlawful and dangerous activity"" including arson, rioting and looting were threatening public safety. Following Walz’s order, Minnesota National Guard Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen said in a social media post at 4:13 p.m, ""We are ready and prepared to answer the Governor's request. We are currently in process of assigning and preparing units to respond."" At 10 p.m., Minneapolis police abandoned the department’s 3rd Precinct which was overtaken and burned. At 10:30 p.m., May 28, Trump watched the scene on television and called Walz, offering to send in the military, WCCO-TV wrote. ""We have activated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities,"" The Minnesota National Guard wrote at 10:41 p.m. May 28 in a social post. ""Our mission is to protect life, preserve property and the right to peacefully demonstrate. A key objective is to ensure fire departments are able to respond to calls."" Protesters demonstrate May 28, 2020, outside of a burning Minneapolis 3rd Police Precinct in Minneapolis. (AP) On May 29, Walz told reporters that he had spoken to Trump the night before. ""At that point in time, it was in the process of where I said that we were going to assume control of this, that it was unnecessary,"" he said. Trump, Walz said, had ""pledged his support in terms of anything we need in terms of supplies to get to us."" Trump tweeted near midnight May 29, 2020, that, ""I can’t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right ....."" In another post that night, Trump wrote : ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" When violence continued May 29 and May 30, 2020, Walz called up more troops and, on May 30, he activated the entire Minnesota National Guard. We don’t know whether Trump’s statements influenced Walz to call in more troops, although the governor’s office told CNN in 2020 that Trump had nothing to do with his decisions. Generally speaking, the president cannot order the U.S. military to perform law-enforcement activities domestically. But there are exceptions, primarily an 1807 law, the Insurrection Act, that allows states to request federal military assistance and allows the president, in limited circumstances, to deploy military personnel in the U.S. without a state’s consent. In general, the U.S. military cannot be used on U.S. soil. That’s been the case since the signing of the Posse Comitatus Act in 1878. RNC pointed to news articles showing that Walz hesitated to send in the National Guard We asked Trump spokespeople for evidence that Walz didn’t call in the National Guard. Republican National Committee spokesperson Anna Kelly pointed to criticism of the timing of Walz’s actions. Minnesota Republicans criticized the governor’s response. The Star Tribune wrote in August 2020 that Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, told reporters in an interview that Walz hesitated to send in the National Guard. Frey said he called Walz on the evening of May 27, 2020, asking him to send in the National Guard and Walz said he would consider it. The newspaper obtained texts and emails to verify that narrative. In his comments to the Star Tribune, Frey said that he asked whether his verbal requests constituted a formal request, and said that the governor's staff confirmed that they did. But the Star Tribune wrote that the governor's office disputed Frey’s portrayal of what had unfolded. At 10:55 a.m. May 28, 2020, Frey’s office made a written request for the National Guard, the Star Tribune wrote. Tschann told the Star Tribune that more information was needed to deploy soldiers and that Walz pushed Minneapolis city officials for details and a strategy. The state Department of Public Safety contracted with Wilder Research, a St. Paul nonprofit, to review the state’s response. The 2022 review found that the timeliness of the guard’s activation was an area for improvement. It also called for improved communication and coordination with local jurisdictions regarding requests for the guard. The report criticized state and local offices’ actions and said the state and the city of Minneapolis had communicated poorly. The Republican National Committee also pointed to a May 30, 2020, article in The Washington Post that said Walz acknowledged the Trump administration’s offer for active-duty military. The U.S. military on May 29, 2020, had ordered several police units to be ready for potential deployment if Walz wanted federal assistance, according to a May 30, 2020, CNN report . By then, Walz had called up the Minnesota National Guard. Our ruling Trump said that during the 2020 Minnesota riots, Walz didn’t call in the National Guard. ""So, I sent in the National Guard to save Minneapolis."" Minneapolis’ mayor, Frey, said Walz initially hesitated to deploy the National Guard on May 27, the day the Minneapolis first requested assistance. But Walz’s executive order shows he called up the National Guard on May 28, before Trump offered federal assistance. We rate Trump’s statement False. RELATED : Who is Tim Walz?

"August 7, 2024",Donald Trump,Kamala Harris “supports mandatory gun confiscation.”,barely-true,"Kamala Harris, as a 2019 presidential primary candidate, said, ""I support a mandatory gun buyback program"" for assault weapons. We found no examples that she supports mandatory gun confiscation now and the majority of guns sold in the U.S. are handguns. Former President Trump used the present tense when he said that Harris ""supports mandatory gun confiscation."" The Harris campaign told The New York Times that she supports banning assault weapons but not requiring their sale to the federal government. As vice president, Harris has urged states to pass red flag laws and supported federal gun safety legislation that included funding for mental health and school security resources.","Former President Donald Trump told supporters in Georgia that Vice President Kamala Harris will take away their guns and leave them ""totally defenseless in your house."" ""She supports mandatory gun confiscation,"" Trump said Aug. 3 at a campaign rally in Atlanta. He added sarcastically, ""Would anybody mind if they came into your house and took away your gun? … She's for taking away all of your guns."" In July, we saw similar statements about Harris’ gun record from the NRA , Gun Owners of America and Dave McCormick , a Pennsylvania Republican running for U.S. Senate. The phrase ""gun confiscation"" is broad and could lead voters to think that Harris wants to confiscate all guns from law-abiding owners. That’s not what she has said. Further, those rights are constitutionally protected by the Second Amendment. In the U.S. gun buybacks are programs organized by local police departments that voluntarily allow people to turn over their guns in exchange for something, such as a gift card. While running in the presidential primary in 2019, the then-California senator said she supported a ""mandatory gun buyback program"" for assault weapons. It did not apply to all guns, and she no longer holds that position. The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for comment. Harris has supported gun buybacks and other measures Harris addressed gun buybacks several times during the 2019 campaign. During an October 2019 gun control forum in Las Vegas , Harris joined two primary rivals in supporting the mandatory buyback of assault weapons. ""We have to have a buyback program, and I support a mandatory gun buyback program,"" Harris said. ""It’s got to be smart, we got to do it the right way. But there are 5 million (assault weapons) at least, some estimate as many as 10 million, and we’re going to have to have smart public policy that’s about taking those off the streets, but doing it the right way."" Assault weapons are not the majority of guns sold in the U.S. Handguns are the most popular. A 1994 federal assault weapons ban , which expired in 2004, barred the ""manufacture, transfer, and possession"" of about 118 firearm models and all magazines holding over 10 rounds. Harris has supported renewing the ban throughout her career . In November 2019, NBC News also reported that Harris then supported a ""mandatory gun buyback."" Harris told the interviewer that ""there is no place"" for assault weapons on the streets. NBC News’ Harry Smith asked Harris, ""So, say you’ve got a couple hundred thousand off the streets, I mean, isn’t that just a drop in the bucket? Harris said: ""Well, what we’ll do is have an incentive for people to turn them in and buy them back. But when we`re talking about weapons of war, I mean, it literally is this simple. Five million assault weapons on the streets of America, period."" The Trump campaign in an X post highlighted Harris’ response to a college student’s question in a September 2019 episode of ""The Tonight Show"" starring Jimmy Fallon. One student asked Harris, ""Do you believe in mandatory buy back of quote unquote ‘assault weapons’ and whether or not you do, how does that idea not go against fundamentally the Second Amendment?"" In its video clip of Harris, the Trump campaign included a couple of sentences of Harris’ remarks. We put the parts that the Trump campaign included in the video in bold: Harris said: ""I do believe that we need to do buybacks."" Then she described assault weapons as ""weapons of war."" She vowed if elected to ""ban on the importation of assault weapons"" and said that the U.S. will have to deal with the assault weapons that are already in the country. ""And, so, a buyback program is a good idea, now we need to do it the right way and part of that has to be buy back and give people their value the financial value of what they have and not just take things from people that have value without compensating them. We need to do it the right way,"" she said. During an April 2019 CNN town hall , Harris referred to her time as state attorney general and said law enforcement was permitted to confiscate guns from people who were found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others. ""I have to stress, lawful gun ownership, that is one thing,"" Harris said. ""We’re talking about something else and we have to stop conflating and blending all these issues."" In April 2019, Harris told reporters in Iowa, ""We are being offered a false choice. You’re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away. It’s a false choice that is born out of a lack of courage from leaders who must recognize and agree that there are some practical solutions to what is a clear problem in our country."" We asked the Harris campaign whether she still supports mandatory assault weapons buybacks. She does not. A campaign spokesperson pointed to a comment the campaign gave to The New York Times that, like President Joe Biden, Harris wants to ban assault weapons but not require people to sell them to the federal government. We found no statements by Harris during calling for mass gun confiscation during her vice presidency. As vice president, Harris has urged states to pass red flag laws and supported federal gun safety legislation that included funding for mental health and school security resources. None of that is akin to gun confiscation. Our ruling Trump said Harris ""supports mandatory gun confiscation."" While running in the 2019 presidential primary, Harris said, ""I support a mandatory gun buyback program"" for assault weapons. This would not cover all guns; handguns, for example, are the most popular. Trump used the present tense when he said that Harris ""supports mandatory gun confiscation."" The Harris campaign told The New York Times that she supports banning assault weapons but not a requirement to sell them to the federal government. We could find no examples that she currently supports mandatory gun confiscation. The claim contains an element of truth about her past position on assault weapons, but it leaves a misleading impression about her platform in 2024. We rate this statement Mostly False.

"August 7, 2024",Kamala Harris,Donald Trump “intends to cut” Medicare.,barely-true,"Former President Donald Trump has said repeatedly during the 2024 presidential campaign that he will not cut Medicare. During his presidency, Trump released four successive annual budgets that proposed cutting Medicare. However, experts are divided on how much those cuts would have hurt beneficiaries had they been enacted.","On the campaign trail, both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have painted former President Donald Trump as a threat to Medicare, the federal health insurance program for all Americans older than 65. A little more than a week after becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris said during a July 30 rally in Atlanta, ""Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare."" We previously rated Harris’ comments about Trump cutting Social Security Mostly False . Here, we’ll examine her statement about Medicare. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has repeatedly said he would not cut Medicare. As president, though, Trump regularly proposed policies that would have reduced Medicare spending. Policy experts disagree about whether Medicare beneficiaries would have borne the brunt of those cuts. ""It’s difficult to know with any certainty what Donald Trump’s agenda for Medicare would be, given the lack of specificity in his platform and the vagueness of phrases like ‘strengthen Medicare’ and ‘protect Medicare,’"" said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health care policy think tank. ""While his campaign platform rules out cuts to Medicare, that could still leave the door open for changes to Medicare that might not look like cuts but that would fundamentally transform the defined-benefit nature of the program."" Defined-benefit programs automatically pay member benefits. In defined-contribution plans, the opposite happens — beneficiaries receive a fixed amount of money from which they must cover all their costs, even if that means members may pay excess costs out of pocket. Trump’s comments about Medicare during the 2024 campaign In his 2024 campaign, Trump has made clear that his Medicare policy is to make no cuts. On Jan. 20, 2023, as part of a series of policy statements called Agenda 47, Trump posted, ""Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security."" He reiterated this stance in the Republican Party platform released earlier this year. In the platform summary, he promised to ""fight for and protect Social Security and Medicare with no cuts."" The party’s full platform document added that the goal is to ""protect Medicare, and ensure seniors receive the care they need without being burdened by excessive costs."" Trump’s Medicare proposals during his presidency When contacted for comment, Harris’ campaign pointed PolitiFact to a variety of proposals for Medicare then-president Trump included in his annual budget proposals, some of which can be characterized as cuts. As with many presidential budget proposals, generally, Trump’s Medicare proposals were not enacted. As president, Trump submitted four successive proposed budgets, covering fiscal years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. Trump proposed eliminating Medicare State Health Insurance Assistance Programs, which advise Medicare recipients on how to sign up for benefits and manage billing disputes. He also proposed raising premiums and charging beneficiaries more for prescription drugs under Medicare Part D; and limiting payments to nursing homes and home health agencies. ""Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare,"" Harris campaign spokesperson Joseph Costello told PolitiFact. ""Trump’s own record makes clear that he will gut critical benefits for millions of Americans if he takes power."" However, other policies Trump advocated for were aimed at curbing spending on providers, not reducing patients’ benefits. This broad goal, and sometimes these specific proposals, have often received bipartisan support . ""In general, these proposals are in areas where there is evidence we pay providers too much,"" Matthew Fiedler, of the Brookings Institution Center for Health Policy, told PolitiFact in 2019. In analyzing Trump’s fiscal year 2021 budget proposal, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget — a group supporting lower deficits — concluded that Trump’s Medicare policies that year ""would not represent reductions in benefits, but instead reductions in cost for roughly the same level of benefits."" On balance, the group said that Trump’s policies ""would actually reduce costs for individuals by lowering premiums and out-of-pocket costs."" What role, if any, would Project 2025 play? Project 2025 is a 922-page policy guide for an incoming Republican administration assembled by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, along with other conservative groups. Democrats have sought to link Project 2025 to Trump , and while the former president has expressed views that align with some of the project’s policy proposals, Project 2025 is distinct from Trump’s official campaign positions and from the Republican Party platform . Trump has rebutted efforts to tie him to it. The blueprint, published in 2023 , says it would make the privately run Medicare option, called Medicare Advantage, the default choice for beneficiaries; increase competitive bidding for services; and ease regulations on prescription drugs, hospice care and medical savings accounts. Experts told PolitiFact that if Trump followed these recommendations, it would not necessarily result in cuts for beneficiaries. ""Policymakers and researchers disagree on whether the reforms outlined in the Project 2025 report would work, and whether there could be adverse consequences,"" said Christine Eibner, a senior economist on health care policy for Rand, a think tank. She added that the same could be said about the policy efforts proposed by the Biden administration. ""While such changes would aim to cut spending, they wouldn’t necessarily reduce beneficiaries’ access to care — although the devil is in the details,"" Eibner said. Joe Antos, a senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said the specific policies urged by Project 2025 are largely in line with past ideas to make Medicare more efficient. ""Simplistic claims from either party about Medicare or their opponent's plans are not useful and generally are misleading,"" Antos said. Our ruling Harris said Trump ""intends to cut"" Medicare. Trump has made clear in speeches and written policy documents during the 2024 campaign that he has no plans to cut Medicare. The Harris campaign points to Trump’s four successive annual budgets in which he proposed policies that could be described as cutting Medicare. However, experts disagree about whether those cuts would have hurt beneficiaries had they been enacted. Some of Trump’s proposed cuts were aimed at curbing spending on providers, a goal that has bipartisan support. We rate the statement Mostly False. "
"August 7, 2024",Tammy Baldwin,"Eric Hovde “wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and kick millions off their health insurance.”",true,"In comments from 2024, 2017 and 2012, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde said he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act Hovde’s website calls for health care reform, but not explicitly repealing the act. Hovde does not lay out specifics for an alternative plan, but said in June he wants to keep protections for preexisting conditions.","It’s been around for well over a decade, but it’s still a hot topic in congressional campaigns in 2024: the Affordable Care Act. That’s true in the U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin faces Republican challenger Eric Hovde. ""My opponent wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and kick millions off their health insurance,"" Baldwin said July 23 at Vice President Kamala Harris’ first presidential campaign rally in West Allis . She’s made similar claims before, including in a post on the social media platform X that has nearly a quarter of a million views. Does Hovde want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare? And has his position on the issue changed over the years? Let’s take a look. Hovde said he supported repealing as recently as June, also in comments back in 2017 and 2012 When we asked Baldwin’s campaign for backup, communications director Andrew Mamo shared a memo with Hovde’s comments about the Affordable Care Act from 2024, 2017 and 2012. The most recent of those examples was in June of this year, when Hovde was interviewed by WMTV 15 , a Madison television station. ""Would you want to repeal the Affordable Care Act?"" the reporter asked. ""Oh, 100%. I think we need to change the Affordable Care Act,"" Hovde answered. Hovde added the ""only thing I think that was worthy in that bill was pre-existing conditions. So, I believe in supporting and keeping pre-existing conditions."" Hovde is referring to the part of the act that says insurers can’t refuse to cover or charge more when people have preexisting conditions: such as multiple sclerosis, which Hovde was diagnosed with in 1991 . Baldwin’s campaign also shared clips of Hovde’s remarks in 2017, when he said he would have voted for two Republican bills that would have repealed and replaced the Affordable Care Act. ""You should push it through. You should get it done because it’s a vast improvement (to) where we are. But is it a perfect bill, absolutely not,"" Hovde told conservative radio host Jerry Bader on WTAQ in June 2017. And in 2012, when he was running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, Hovde made multiple comments that he’d repeal the law. One of those instances was during an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board, in which Hovde said he’d repeal the ACA ""in its entirety."" ""I think we need to move back to a free-market approach to solve a lot of these problems. I think we need to break up the mini-monopolies in every single state,"" Hovde said. While those are statements from the past, his comments from June indicate he still wants to repeal the ACA. Hovde says he wants reform on his website, but doesn’t suggest Affordable Care Act alternatives Meanwhile, PolitiFact Wisconsin reached the Hovde campaign, but they didn’t have anything to add from his most recent interview on the matter. But we can glean more information from Hovde’s campaign website, where he lists health care reform as one of his top four issues , along with the cost of living, immigration and foreign policy. On the health care page , Hovde doesn’t explicitly say he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, rather that the health care system is ""deeply flawed and in need of reform."" The webpage ""has many inaccurate statements and misrepresentations of data,"" said Donna Friedsam, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies health care policy and reform. To be clear, we’re fact-checking Baldwin here, not Hovde. But it’s important context for understanding why he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. For example, prescription drug prices did not ""skyrocket,"" as Hovde asserts on the website. The average price of a prescription has not increased considerably in recent years, Friedsam said, pointing to a Congressional Budget Office analysis from 2022. That’s partly because of rebate discounts and lower-cost generic drugs that offset rising prices for brand names. Finally, Hovde also doesn’t lay out specifics of an alternative plan he wants to see. His June comments indicated he wants to keep protections for preexisting conditions, but there’s not much more information on his campaign website. Would millions get kicked off their health insurance if ACA is repealed? Finally, let’s look at the last part of Baldwin’s claim, that ""millions"" would get kicked off their health insurance if the ACA is repealed. PolitiFact has examined a similar claim before , when Biden said over a hundred million Americans would lose protections for preexisting conditions if former President Donald Trump repealed the law. Baldwin’s campaign pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a 2023 fact sheet from the White House. The White House cited a Congressional Budget Office estimate from 2017 that found the Republican repeal legislation would ""grow the ranks of the uninsured by 23 million."" And the number of people with some type of Affordable Care Act coverage has grown since 2017, the White House noted. They put the number at 40 million people whose insurance would be at risk. The picture is a bit complicated when estimating what would happen if the ACA was repealed. But Baldwin does seem on par that millions would lose their insurance or be at risk. Our ruling Baldwin said Hovde ""wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and kick millions off their health insurance."" Hovde made comments in the past, and as recently as June, that he does want to repeal the law. He calls for health care reform on his website, but doesn’t explicitly call for repealing the ACA. That website also contains inaccuracies and misrepresentations about the ACA, according to a health care expert that reviewed it. Hovde doesn’t lay out an alternative plan. We rate Baldwin’s claim True. "
"August 6, 2024",X posts,Tim Walz “changed the Minnesota flag so it could resemble the Somalian flag.”,false,"After a monthslong selection process, a Minnesota commission chose a new design for the state’s flag that was adopted May 11. The flag includes a star and blue coloring, as does Somalia’s national flag, but Somalia’s flag was not an inspiration, said a Minnesota man whose flag concept inspired the final design. The Minnesota flag has an eight-pointed star, while Somalia’s star is five-pointed. The dark blue surrounding the star on the Minnesota flag represents the state’s shape and the light blue on the right represents the state’s abundant lakes and rivers.","A day before Vice President Kamala Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her presidential running mate, a social media user tried to tie Walz to a new state flag that some have said resembles flags from Somalia. An Aug. 5 X post said, ""Kamala Harris’s VP choice, Tim Walz, is the governor who just changed the Minnesota flag so it could resemble the Somalian flag."" It included a video of Walz introducing the new flag and an image of several regional Somali flags from a Wikipedia page. Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the U.S., and Minnesotans elected Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar as the first Somali-born representative in Congress. Of the state’s roughly 5.7 million population, as of 2021, 86,610 were Somali , reports Minnesota Compass, a research project led by Wilder Research. A new state flag adopted May 11 has for months been the subject of online misinformation from critics who say it resembles the Somali flag or regional flags from that country. Many of those claims were based on proposed Minnesota flag designs and not on the state flag’s final design . Since Harris announced Aug. 6 that Walz would join the Democratic ticket, we found multiple social media posts reviving false claims about the new Minnesota flag and its supposed resemblances to Somalia flags. The Somalia national flag has a light-blue background with a five-pointed white star in the center. The Minnesota state flag features a white, eight-pointed star on a dark blue background on the left, and light blue coloring on the right. The Somalia national flag, left, and the Minnesota state flag. (Embassy of Somalia-USA, Minnesota State Emblems Redesign Commission) Although both flags have stars and similar colors, as do many flags, Somalia’s flag did not serve as an inspiration for Minnesota’s, Andrew Prekker , a Minnesota man whose flag concept inspired the final design, told PolitiFact. And Walz played no role in the new flag’s design. Minnesota’s Legislature in 2023 established the State Emblems Redesign Commission to replace the state’s flag and seal. The state flag had been in use since 1957 and featured a Native American riding away on horseback while a white settler plowed his field — a design considered offensive by some of the state’s Native American population because it symbolized their displacement. The new flag was chosen after a monthslong selection process that drew 2,128 design entries. ""Governor Walz did not have a seat on the commission and did not have approval over the flag design or adoption,"" Cassondra Knudson, a spokesperson for Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon — a voting member of the commission — told PolitiFact in an email. Walz appointed three of the commission’s 13 voting members, including its vice chair. A Walz spokesperson did not return a request for comment. The governor has criticized the state’s old flag as ""problematic."" He said of the new flag, ""We've evolved into a more diverse state and I think it's more reflective of that,"" according to a May report by WCCO-TV , a CBS News affiliate. . Simon, in a December commission meeting before the final design was chosen, spoke about complaints about the flag design proposals’ resemblance to other countries’ flags; he noted that Iowa’s state flag bears a resemblance to the French flag and Texas’ state flag is similar to Chile’s. Prekker said in a May 19 Instagram post that it’s his ""greatest hope that all Minnesotans — including those within our Tribal nations and indigenous communities — feel represented by the flag."" Prekker’s winning design entry included horizontal white, green and light blue stripes to the right of a white, eight-pointed star on a blue background. He said in a statement accompanying his entry that the navy blue on the left was the abstract shape of Minnesota and the star in the navy blue represented the state’s motto: ""L'etoile du Nord, meaning ""star of the north,""and also represents a symbol of unity above a land of diversity."" A flag from Somalia’s Jubaland state seen in the X post we are checking bears a resemblance to Prekker’s original concept with horizontal green, blue and white stripes, and a five-pointed star in blue on the left side. The horizontal stripes representing snow and agriculture that Prekker proposed were removed in the final design. Andrew Prekker’s design that was used to create the final version of Minnesota’s state flag. (State Emblems Redesign Committee) Prekker told PolitiFact that Walz ""has nothing to do with the creation of the flag, and Somalia has nothing to do with the flag design."" Prekker said he submitted three flag designs and used only other U.S. state flags for inspiration, not flags of other countries. ""Somalia had absolutely nothing to do with my flag during any point in the creation process,"" he said. Prekker said he and the selection committee, with the help of others, revised the North Star on his design to be a north-facing ""selburose star,"" which has more relevance to the state’s history as it is seen in Indigenous people’s art and is also on the floor of the Minnesota State Capitol’s rotunda. The white and green horizontal stripes were removed because they cluttered the design, which allowed the flag to better ""focus on what's really unique about Minnesota: our waters,"" he said. The final design based on Prekker’s concept has an eight-pointed star that represents the North Star, surrounded by a dark blue field that represents the night sky and the state’s shape, the Redesign Commission said in its final report to the governor and Legislature. The right side of the flag is a light blue field that represents the state’s ""abundance of water,"" noting that Minnesota has 11,842 lakes and 6,564 rivers and streams. ""A hundred flags have the color blue and some form of a white star. There is zero connection to Somalia or any other country,"" Prekker said. ""Any similarities people want to see are a coincidence. It is a Minnesotan flag, and that is what I designed it for."" Anita Gaul, the Redesign Commission's vice chair, said the flag design had nothing at all to do with Somalia. There is no reference to Somalia or the state’s Somali population in the commission’s report describing what each of the flag’s elements represent. The star ""also represents many cultures over time and across the globe,"" the report said, adding that the star ""has been used extensively in quilting by both Indigenous people and some new immigrants."" Our ruling An X post claims Walz changed the Minnesota flag to resemble Somalia’s flag. But Walz played no role in a state commission’s monthslong process to choose a new design for the state flag and logo, other than appointing three commission members. The flag’s design was not created with Somalia in mind, according to a state commission's report, its vice chair and the creator whose design inspired the final version. We rate the claim False. "
"August 6, 2024",Social Media,"Kamala Harris’ X post said the Olympics’ opening ceremony “made France look great! America, this is what we need to strive towards!”",false,A review of Vice President Kamala Harris’ social media accounts confirmed that she never posted on X on the day of or in the days following the 2024 Paris Olympics’ opening ceremony. The post appears to have originated on a satire site.,"Some critics of Vice President Kamala Harris are claiming she posted on X praising the Paris Olympics’ opening ceremony, which generated controversy. A July 28 X post that included a screenshot of what appeared to be a Harris X post that said, ""What an impressive show by all of these beautiful and diverse people at the Opening Ceremony of The Olympics! Director Thomas Jolly did an incredible job, and made France look great! America, this is what we need to strive towards!"" But Harris didn’t post on X with that, or anything else, reacting to the Olympics’ opening ceremony. The screenshot went viral on Instagram and X. The screenshot appears to have originated July 27 on an X account called Simply Satire. The fabricated post shows three scenes screenshotted from the July 26 opening ceremony. The ceremony included scenes with performers dressed in drag that conservative lawmakers have criticized, saying they appeared to mock ""The Last Supper."" Jolly, the Paris Olympics’ artistic director, said July 28 on French TV that the scene was meant to depict a Dionysian pagan celebration. We found no evidence that Harris posted the statement on her X accounts, @KamalaHarris, @VP and @KamalaHQ. When contacted for comment, Harris’ campaign called the post ""obviously untrue."" Social media analytics platform Social Blade shows that Harris’ X account did not delete any posts July 26 or 27. An Aug. 5 review of Harris’ accounts on X, Instagram, TikTok and Facebook showed no posts about the Olympics’ opening ceremony as of that date. A search of her three X accounts for the term ""Olympics"" shows that her most recent post on the topic was from 2020. On her @VP X and TikTok accounts, Harris posted in July to thank the USA men’s basketball team for representing the nation at the Summer Games. The opening ceremony scene sparked discussion among Republicans and religious leaders. Trump said July 29 on Fox News that the opening ceremony had ""scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity."" Similarly, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., wrote July 27 on X that the opening ceremony was insulting to Christian people. Social media claims used a fabricated tweet to claim that Harris posted on social media that the Olympics’ Opening Ceremony ""made France look great!

"August 6, 2024",Laura Loomer,“Nowhere on her birth certificate does it say that she is BLACK OR AFRICAN. … Kamala Harris is NOT black and never has been.”,false,"Kamala Harris’ birth certificate, issued in 1964, does not describe her race. It lists her mother as being from India and lists her ""color or race"" as Caucasian. It lists her father as being from Jamaica and his ""color or race"" as Jamaican. Though it doesn’t say so on the certificate, her father, Donald J. Harris, is a Black man. Throughout her public life, Kamala Harris has identified herself as a Black woman who grew up in a multicultural home.","After former President Donald Trump questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial identity July 31 at the National Association of Black Journalists convention, some of his supporters used social media to echo his baseless claim that she hasn’t identified as Black until recently. Laura Loomer, a conservative activist, shared a copy of what she said was Harris’ birth certificate in a July 31 X post and wrote, ""Nowhere on her birth certificate does it say that she is BLACK OR AFRICAN. @KamalaHQ is a liar. Donald Trump is correct. Kamala Harris is NOT black and never has been."" Loomer shared a similar post on Truth Social, which Trump reshared. We contacted Loomer for more evidence to support her claim and she said, ""Jamaican is a nationality. Not a race. You do understand there are white Jamaicans right? Nowhere does it say she’s black."" ""Her birth certificate says Caucasian and Jamaican. Can you tell me where on that birth certificate it says she’s black? Or are you preparing to lie and say that all Jamaicans are black?"" Loomer added. The birth certificate does not address Kamala Harris’ race. She has long identified as a Black woman throughout her life and political career and also embraces her Indian heritage. About the birth certificate The version of the birth certificate Loomer shared matches one that was published online in August 2020 by the Bay Area News Group to accompany a San Jose Mercury News article about her eligibility to be vice president. That version of the birth certificate shows Harris’ father, Donald Harris, was born in Jamaica and her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born in India. In a box that says ""color or race"" of the mother and father, it listed ""Caucasian"" for Gopalan and ""Jamaican"" for Donald Harris. There is no box for the child’s race. The birth certificate in Loomer’s post is an ""informational copy"" that anyone can request. It can’t be used for identification, as a ""certified copy"" can. Those copies contain the same information, with some possible redactions on the informational copy. Both are considered ""certified"" copies, the California Department of Public Health said . The state also keeps a confidential section of a birth record that is only available to certain people, and includes medical and social information such as ""race, occupation and medical data,"" that is often used for public health or research purposes, a California Department of Public Health website about obtaining a birth certificate copy said. The confidential portion of Harris’ birth certificate did not contain more specific information about her parents’ race, as that information was on the public portion, the department said. State law says only the person named on the birth certificate, the parent who signed it, or if no parent signed it, the mother, or a person who has petitioned to adopt the child named on the certificate, may request this confidential copy. The state’s current certificate of live birth also doesn’t collect information on the race or ethnicity of the child. Previous versions collected information specified by law over the years, but the child’s race hasn’t been a field on recent birth records, including in 1964, the health department said in an email to PolitiFact after publication of this story. A blank version of California’s current live birth certificate provided to PolitiFact has boxes for the birthplace of parents, but no box for their race. In the confidential section, there’s a box to list whether a parent is ""Hispanic, Latino or Spanish"" and another to list up to three races or ethnicities. It does not have a box for the race of the child. The birth certificate does not list Kamala Harris’ race, but that doesn’t tell us anything about her racial identity. It also doesn’t mention Donald Harris’ race, but he is Black. Attacks about racial identity and ethnicity have followed Harris throughout her political career. Conservatives have recently revived baseless birther accusations that Harris is ineligible to be president because her parents were not U.S. citizens. (To be clear: She was born in the U.S. and is eligible to be president.) Jamaican demographics It’s true, as Loomer said, that Jamaican is a nationality, not a race. However, the vast majority of Jamacians (92.1%) are Black, according to a 2011 Population and Housing Census report . That report showed that about 0.16% of Jamaica’s 2.6 million-person-plus population is white. A more recent population Census that began in 2022 has not been finalized . Genetic studies have shown that the vast majority of Jamacians descended from people from sub-Saharan Africa. The African diaspora refers to many communities of people of African descent dispersed throughout the world through historic movements, including slavery. About 15 million African men, women and children were kidnapped from their homelands and sold into enslavement throughout the Americas and the Caribbean. Experts told PolitiFact in an earlier story that people who say Jamaican people are not African ignore slavery’s global reach. ""Slavery impacted many people from Africa, and we went to many places,"" Howard University political science professor Keneshia Grant said. ""Harris’ father’s people got dropped off in Jamaica. Mine got dropped off in Haiti. The African diaspora is huge, and it is worldwide, so to suggest that a Jamaican is not African, or connected to Africa is not acknowledging the vestiges of slavery."" Harris’ Jamaican-born father, Donald Harris, became the first Black scholar to gain tenure in Stanford University’s economics department, The New York Times and The Washington Post have reported. In a 2018 essay about sharing his Jamaican roots with his daughters, Donald Harris lamented court-appointed limits in his custody battle for his daughters, sarcastically writing that they were ""based on the false assumption by the State of California that fathers cannot handle parenting (especially in the case of this father, ""a neegroe from da eyelans"" was the Yankee stereotype, who might just end up eating his children for breakfast!)."" Kamala Harris in a 2003 profile in AsianWeekly, referred to her father as ""a Black man."" We contacted Donald Harris and Kamala Harris’ campaign but did not immediately receive a response. How does Kamala Harris self-identify? Harris has long identified publicly as a Black woman who grew up in a multicultural household. In her 2019 autobiography, ""The Truths We Hold: An American Journey ,"" Harris wrote that she and her sister, Maya, were ""raised with a strong awareness of and an appreciation for Indian culture."" She added that her ""mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters"" and was determined that they ""would grow into confident, proud black women."" Harris moved from California to Montreal when she was in middle school when her mother, by then separated from Kamala’s father, took a teaching position there. In high school, Harris identified as Black, some of her classmates told The New York Times in 2020. Harris returned to the U.S. to attend Howard University, a historically Black university, in Washington, D.C., and later earned her law degree at the University of California, Hastings in 1989. At Howard, Harris pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically Black sorority. As a senator, Harris was in the Congressional Black Caucus. Throughout her political career, Harris has identified herself as a Black woman who also embraced her South Asian heritage. Her official California attorney general biography said she was ""the first African American woman and South Asian American woman in California to hold the office."" Her official White House biography said she was the ""first woman, the first Black American, and the first South Asian American"" to be elected as vice president. In a 2019 interview on ""The Breakfast Club"" radio show, Harris said, ""I’m Black, and I’m proud of being Black. And I was born Black. I will die Black."" Our ruling Loomer claimed a birth certificate proves Harris is not Black and never has been because it doesn’t say she is Black or African. But Harris’ birth certificate did not include information about her race. The certificate did list her parents’ birthplace and ""color or race."" Her mother, born in India, listed ""Caucasian"" and her father, a Black man born in Jamaica, listed ""Jamaican."" The certificate does not say Kamala Harris is Black, nor does it say she is not. Harris has long identified as a Black woman who also embraced her Indian heritage. The claim that a birth certificate that doesn’t assign a race to her is proof that she’s not Black is False. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this fact-check. UPDATE, Aug. 7, 5:30 p.m. : This story was updated to include more information about California birth certificates from the California Department of Public Health received after publication. The ruling is unchanged.  "
"• August 2,",Claudia Tenney,Biden Executive Order 14019 “requires our taxpayer-funded federal agencies to violate the Hatch Act and engage in illegal vote harvesting.”,pants-fire,"The National Voter Registration Act, passed in 1993, states that voter registration agencies may include federal offices. Executive Order 14019 states that when agencies carry out the order, all applicable laws must be followed. The order does not command federal agencies to collect ballots.","A New York lawmaker has joined other Republicans taking fresh aim at a 3-year-old executive order from President Biden. U.S. Rep. Claudia Tenney claims the order violates the law limiting federal employees from engaging in partisan political activity and requires federal offices to illegally collect ballots. Experts on election law say that’s a false interpretation of Biden’s order which was designed to promote information about voter registration. Tenney, a Republican seeking re-election in a district that reaches from the North Country into Western New York, claimed on Facebook that Biden's executive order ""requires our taxpayer-funded federal agencies to violate the Hatch Act and engage in illegal vote harvesting."" The Hatch Act limits partisan political activity by federal employees and by state and local employees who deliver federally funded programs during work hours and bans them from using government offices and resources. We wondered how this order could require federal employees to engage in partisan political activity and illegally harvest votes. ""Ballot harvesting"" or ""vote harvesting"" is a term often used by people in a pejorative way to refer to collecting completed absentee ballots and submitting them. Some voting rights experts see the term ""ballot harvesting"" as pejorative and prefer the term ""ballot collection."" Many states allow at least certain individuals to collect some ballots on behalf of others. Biden signed Executive Order 14019 on March 7, 2021. It builds on a 1993 law, the National Voter Registration Act , which aimed to expand opportunities for eligible voters to register at places such as military recruiting offices, state motor vehicle departments and federal agencies. The National Voter Registration Act specifies that voter registration activities must be nonpartisan and that the ""person providing assistance at a voter registration agency cannot attempt to influence an applicant’s political preference or party registration"" or make an applicant believe that public benefits or services are dependent on decisions related to their registration, according to the Congressional Research Service . Biden’s order states that ""the head of each agency shall evaluate ways in which the agency can, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, promote voter registration and voter participation."" These activities include updating websites and other public-facing materials with information on how to register to vote, how to request a vote-by-mail ballot, and how to cast a ballot in upcoming elections, and pointing visitors to their own states’ election information. A state can request that federal agencies be designated voter registration agencies, under the order, and states must approve of any such designation. Military recruitment offices are already voter registration agencies under the National Voter Registration Act. We approached Tenney’s office for evidence of her claim, and a spokesperson told us the executive order directs federal agencies, who employ political appointees, to promote access to voting. The Hatch Act prohibits civil service employees in the executive branch from engaging in political activity, and by using civil service employees to ""handpick"" who they register to vote, the Biden administration is engaging in illegal vote harvesting, she said. Experts we spoke with said the order does not violate the Hatch Act and does not lead to vote harvesting. ""The order has nothing to do with ‘ballot harvesting,’ in any way that term could be defined,"" said David J. Becker , executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a nonpartisan organization that works with election officials from both political parties. ""It is merely an order authorizing federal agencies to cooperate with the states to provide voter registration opportunities to all citizens through those agencies."" Harvesting can be a scary word, conjuring up images of collecting ballots from people against their will or collecting fraudulent ballots. But ballot distribution and collection is still run by the states under this order, said Jonathan Diaz, director of voting advocacy and partnerships at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan organization that promotes voting. Trevor Potter, a Republican and former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, founded the legal center. ""This is not directing federal agencies to do anything in support of a candidate or party or ballot initiative,"" Diaz said. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel issued two opinions in the early 2000s about whether voter registration drives in federal offices violate the Hatch Act. The office has found that registration drives organized by nonpartisan organizations are allowed . Partisan drives, those with a goal of helping a party or candidate, are not allowed . ""Nonpartisan voter registration is not partisan, and therefore is not a problem under the Hatch Act,"" said Sean Morales-Doyle , director of the Voting Rights Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. Our ruling Tenney claimed that Executive Order 14019 ""requires our taxpayer-funded federal agencies to violate the Hatch Act and engage in illegal vote harvesting."" Her use of the words ""requires"" and ""violate"" are not suggestions of what the order could do. They are strong words, but they are wrong. The order calls on federal agencies to expand voter registration activities and to do so within the bounds of the law. The Hatch Act prohibits partisan political activities in government offices. Promoting voter registration to would-be eligible voters who come in contact with federal agencies is not a partisan activity. The order does not require federal agencies to violate the Hatch Act. The order also does not call for federal agencies to collect any ballots, so the claim of illegal vote harvesting is baseless. This statement makes a ridiculous claim, and we rate it Pants on Fire! "

"July 31, 2024",Donald Trump,"Kamala Harris was “Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and she went, she became a Black person.”",pants-fire,,"In a contentious appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists annual conference in Chicago, former President Donald Trump argued with moderators over their questions and opened the conversation accusing Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, of recently becoming Black. When asked whether he agreed with some Republicans characterizing Harris as a ""DEI hire,"" Trump launched into an unwieldy attack, claiming Harris had always promoted being Indian and that he ""didn’t know"" whether she was Black. ""She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So, I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?"" Trump said July 31 . ""I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and she went, she became a Black person."" Trump tried to double down on Truth Social after the event, sharing a video of Harris with Indian actress Mindy Kaling, in which Harris says she is Indian. The video isn’t evidence that she didn’t also identify with her Black heritage. This is a false mischaracterization of Harris’ background and heritage, and how she has spoken about, and identified with, her race and ethnicity. Trump’s attack isn’t new, and harks to the ""birtherism"" conspiracies he and others baselessly pushed about former President Barack Obama for years. Harris, born of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, has identified as a Black woman who grew up in a multicultural household. These kinds of claims reflect a poor understanding of history and the fluid nature and various interpretations of racial identity in the United States, race and politics experts say. ""The approach to Harris in this instance, the attempt to ‘other’ her, is a common practice in American politics,"" said Keneshia Grant, a political science professor at Howard University. ""These tactics will continue because they work. People have to prepare themselves to check their own biases and fears and use logic and facts to guide their decision-making when these kinds of attacks occur."" The Harris campaign sent PolitiFact its statement on Trump’s NABJ appearance. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who is Black, called the comments ""repulsive"" and ""insulting."" The Trump campaign did not respond with evidence to support his assertions. Harris’ background Harris is the daughter of an immigrant mother from India, Shyamala Gopalan, and an immigrant father from Jamaica, Donald Harris. She grew up in a Black middle-class neighborhood in Berkeley, California, where her parents would often join civil rights protests. Donald Harris immigrated to the U.S. from Jamaica after he got into the University of California, Berkeley, Kamala Harris wrote in her 2019 autobiography, ""The Truths We Hold: An American Journey."" Shyamala Harris was born in Chennai, India, and moved to California after graduating from the University of Delhi to pursue a doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology at Berkeley. The couple separated when Harris was 5 and divorced a few years later, Harris wrote in her book. Kamala Harris lived in California until she was in middle school, when she moved to Montreal after her mother was offered a teaching position at McGill University. Harris attended college at Howard University, an historically Black university, in Washington, D.C., and earned her law degree at the University of California, Hastings in 1989. Harris has identified as Black woman from a multicultural family Harris has embraced her Black identity and multicultural background in several ways. When she was at Howard University, Harris pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically Black sorority. As a U.S. senator, Harris was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, supporting her colleagues’ legislation to strengthen voting rights and policing reforms. The New York Times in 2020 spoke with some of Harris’ high school classmates from Montreal. They told reporters Harris identified as Black back then, too, while navigating complicated racial and social divisions at the school. ""In high school, you were either in the white or the Black group,"" Wanda Kagan, her best friend from Westmount High School, who had a white mother and a Black father, told the Times . ""We didn’t fit exactly into either, so we made ourselves fit into both."" Although Harris was able to navigate her intersectionality, Kagan told the newspaper that ""she identified as being African-American"" and found belonging in the Black community there, adding that she and Harris would attend Black community dance parties and gripe about having to be home by 11 p.m. In 2007, when questions arose about former President Barack Obama’s Blackness as he ran for president, Harris, then San Francisco’s district attorney, said many Americans have a limited perception of Black people. ""We are diverse and multifaceted,"" Harris said. ""People are bombarded with stereotypical images and so they are limited in their ability to imagine our capacity."" In 2010, when Harris was months away from being elected as California’s attorney general, one story described her as being raised in a Black neighborhood, where she attended Black churches, but also worshiped in her mother’s Hindu temple and had made visits to her family in India. ""Running for office, you have to simplify or condense or put into preexisting boxes who you are, so people will have a sense of you based on what they easily and quickly identify,"" Harris said. ""I grew up in a family where I had a strong sense of my culture and who I am, and I never felt insecure about that at all. Slowly, perhaps, with each of us taking on more prominent positions, people will start to understand the diversity of the people."" Harris told The Washington Post in 2019 that she identifies as ""an American,"" and that she’s been comfortable with her identity from an early age, something she credits to her Hindu immigrant single mother, who adopted Black culture and immersed her daughters in it. Harris said she grew up embracing her Indian culture while proudly living as a Black girl. She said the same in her book. She told the Post that she hasn’t spent much time dwelling on how to categorize herself, but being forced to define herself was more of a struggle when she first ran for office. When Harris and President Joe Biden campaigned together as running mates in summer 2020, they highlighted the historic nature of Harris’ candidacy: the first Black woman and the first South Asian American to be nominated for national office by a major party in the United States. Our ruling Trump said Harris was Indian and then ""made a turn"" and ""became a Black person."" This is blatant mischaracterization of Harris’ heritage and how she has spoken about, and has identified with, her racial background and ethnicity. Harris, born of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, has long identified as a Black woman who grew up in a multicultural household. She attended a historically Black university, pledged an historically Black sorority, and has given interviews and written about her experience embracing her Indian culture while living as a Black woman.

Unless we overthrow them in some way, we're gonna keep losing” pic.twitter.com/2sVHp4i1ek — Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) July 27, 2024 We also saw a similar post on Meta’s Threads platform, which presented the clip as ""a stunning new leak"" showing Vance’s alleged endorsement of Project 2025. That post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Project 2025 refers to a 922-page guide for an incoming Republican administration. The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank leading Project 2025, published the document April 21, 2023 . But the Harris campaign’s claim is inaccurate: This video does not show Vance endorsing Project 2025 — he made these comments in 2021, more than a month before announcing his Senate run and two years before the Project 2025 plan was made public. What did Vance say? The Federalist, a conservative news outlet, first posted this video of Vance May 18, 2021 , on its YouTube channel. Vance launched his Senate bid in early July 2021. The clip from the Harris’ campaign’s X post appears about 25 minutes into the full interview, when Federalist co-founder Ben Domenech asked Vance how he might help close what he described as a growing divide between military and nonmilitary families. Here was Vance’s full response. Vance: ""I think part of the answer is that the next time that we get power, whether it’s in the Senate or the House or the presidency — we’re talking President (Ron) DeSantis in 2024 or President (Donald) Trump round two in 2024 — I think the thing that we have to take away from the last 10 years is that we really need to be really ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power. ""I was talking about this with someone earlier today, where, you remember there was some threat that congressional or Senate Republicans made, ‘If you get rid of the filibuster, we’re gonna do X, Y and Z.’ And you actually look at it, it’s like, well this is, this is not that interesting. Like — "" Domenech, laughing: ""We’re going to actually deliver on the promises we’ve made for decades."" Vance: ""Right? You know, this is the threat? ‘If you get rid of the filibuster we’re going to do this stuff?’ They’re talking about expanding the Supreme Court; they’re talking about adding two senators from heavily Democratic places."" … Vance : ""So, I think, I mean, look. I am a cynic about this and maybe even a little bit of a pessimist. But I think the challenge confronting American conservatives is that we have lost every major powerful institution in the country, except for maybe churches and religious institutions, which of course are weaker now than they’ve ever been. We’ve lost big business, we’ve lost finance, we’ve lost the culture, we’ve lost the economy. And if we’re going to really, actually affect real change in the country it will require us completely replacing the existing ruling class with another ruling class. I say that, knowing and hearing myself — it sounds really hard. It is really hard. But I don’t think there’s, like a detente with these people. I don't think there’s sort of a compromise that we’re going to come with the people who currently actually control the country. Unless we overthrow them in some way, we’re going to keep losing. And that’s the challenge. Now, it’s not easy. It requires us to build institutions. It requires us to support, you know, alternative media institutions and alternative media programs. It requires us to elect different people at all levels of government. And it requires us to be willing to use the power vested in our constitutional republic to go after some of our enemies in big business. Those things are all really hard, but I don’t know how else to do it."" Vance mentioned neither Project 2025 nor The Heritage Foundation in the interview; it would be two more years before the plan would be published. Asked for evidence of its claim, Harris’ campaign said the video showed Vance voicing support for policies similar to those promoted in Project 2025. The campaign also pointed to Vance’s remarks about Project 2025 and his affiliations with its contributors. For example, part of Project 2025 calls for extensive executive-branch overhauls, including reclassifying thousands of civil servants as political appointees , therefore increasing the number of federal workers who would advance conservative goals . This aligns with a strategy Vance promoted in 2021. But this lacks context, too. Democrats have linked Project 2025 to former President Donald Trump when attacking its proposals, but the Heritage Foundation-produced guide is neither an official Trump campaign position nor the Republican party platform . Although both Trump and Vance have expressed some views that align with some of the policy proposals laid out in Project 2025, neither have issued a blanket endorsement of the plan. Trump has rebutted attacks tying him to Project 2025, saying he knows ""nothing about it"" and has ""no idea who is behind it."" On July 30, the Heritage Foundation said the project’s director, Paul Dans, would step down . What has Vance said about Project 2025? Vance has expressed support from some — but not all — of the ideas Project 2025 promotes. ""I think most Americans couldn’t care less about Project 2025,"" Vance said during a July Newsmax interview . ""I’ve reviewed a lot of it. There’s some good ideas in there, Rob, there’s some things that I disagree with. But most importantly, it has no affiliation with the Trump campaign."" Vance has some ties to The Heritage Foundation. He wrote the foreword for an upcoming book written by the Heritage Foundation’s president, Kevin Roberts, who is an architect and promoter of Project 2025. Vance spoke at the Heritage Foundation’s 50th Anniversary Leadership Summit in April 2023, when he said that if Republicans won the White House in 2024, ""This organization is going to play a major role in helping us figure out how to govern."" We contacted Vance’s office and received no reply. Our ruling Harris’ campaign claimed a video it posted on X showed that ""JD Vance endorses Project 2025."" The video was posted in May 2021, nearly two years before Project 2025’s 922-page conservative policy guide was published in April 2023. Vance did not mention nor endorse Project 2025 then. We rate that claim False. PolitiFact Staff Writer Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu and PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.  "

Aunque publicaciones dicen que se estaban llevando las cajas electorales en el estado Falcón, no encontramos fuentes oficiales que reportaran el robo de estas en esa zona. Dudas sobre los resultados de las elecciones en Venezuela En Venezuela, los votos son contados de dos formas. Una es vía el conteo digital que es enviado a las autoridades electorales a través de líneas telefónicas encriptadas. La otra forma envuelve a boletas impresas; las máquinas en los centros de votación imprimen una boleta que confirma el voto de una persona, luego este se pone en una caja. La máquina también imprime unas actas con todos los votos registrados al final de la elección. Las boletas y actas deben coincidir para confirmar los resultados de cada centro de votación, según el Observatorio Electoral Venezolano, una organización no gubernamental basada en Venezuela que monitorea y analiza las elecciones. Después de la elección del 28 de julio, el Secretario de Estado de Estados Unidos, Anthony Blinken, quien estaba en Tokio, expresó preocupación de que el resultado de la elección venezolana ""no refleje la voluntad o los votos del pueblo venezolano"". ""Es fundamental que cada voto se cuente de forma justa y transparente, que los funcionarios electorales compartan inmediatamente la información con la oposición y los observadores independientes sin demora y que las autoridades electorales publiquen la tabulación detallada de los votos. La comunidad internacional está observando de cerca y va a responder acordemente"", le dijo Blinken, en inglés, a reporteros el 29 de julio. La líder de la oposición venezolana, María Corina Machado, dijo que los resultados de la elección fueron fraudulentos. (Edmundo González Urrutia reemplazó a Machado como el candidato presidencial de la oposición cuando el Tribunal Supremo de Justicia inhabilitó a Machado de lanzarse como candidata para cualquier cargo por 15 años). ""Osea esto no es un fraude más, osea esto es desconocer y violar grosera, groseramente la soberania popular, no hay manera que ellos puedan explicar y justificar esto, no con la informacion que tenemos"", le dijo Machado el 29 de julio a medios de comunicación nacionales e internacionales. Machado dijo que los resultados dados por el gobierno venezolano son ""imposibles"", porque no concuerdan con las actas de votos que su equipo recolectó, las cuales ella dijo mostraron 6.2 millones de votos para González Urrutia y 2.8 millones para Maduro. ""Tenemos en nuestras manos las actas que demuestran nuestro triunfo histórico, categórico y matemáticamente irreversible"", dijo González Urrutia el 29 de julio. The New York Times reportó el 28 de julio que ""en algunos centros de votación clave, los funcionarios electorales se negaron a entregar los recuentos en papel a los observadores electorales"" y que hubo reportes de intimidación de votantes e irregularidades. Telemundo 51 también reportó el 28 de julio denuncias de irregularidades en las votaciones venezolanas. Nuestro veredicto Publicaciones en redes sociales dicen que un video muestra un robo de votos en la elección del 2024 en Venezuela.

Netflix itself did not donate to Harris’ campaign; corporations are barred from donating to federal elections.","Spoiler alert: Netflix’s stock didn’t plummet 40% after the company donated to Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, contrary to viral social media posts. That claim originated as satire. A July 26 Facebook post included an image of Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, with the headline, ""Netflix stock tumbled almost 40% after big campaign donation announcement - $2 billion lost in 4 hours."" The post’s caption read, ""Perhaps big corps will learn to stay out of politics … I couldn’t be any happier about this!!"" Similar posts gained traction on X. The social media posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. The posts fall into the fiction genre; they originated from a website called the Dunning-Kruger Times, which describes its content as ""parody, satire, and tomfoolery."" (Screenshot from Facebook) ""Netflix, the company long associated with the Obamas, has gone fully woke and donated $7 million to the Kamala Harris campaign,"" the article said. ""In return, the American people canceled subscriptions at an alarming rate and the company lost billions in market cap overnight."" The article alludes to a real $7 million donation made by Reed Hastings, Netflix’s co-founder and executive chairman, to a super PAC supporting Harris’ presidential campaign. But the article and social media posts falsely claim that the donation came from the company, rather than Hastings. The Federal Election Commission’s website says that ""campaigns may not accept contributions from the treasury funds of corporations."" Netflix does have a political action committee, Netflix Inc PAC, and can use it to donate to candidates. But according to its FEC filings , it last contributed money to a candidate in 2018, when it donated $5,000 to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s California gubernatorial campaign. We also found no evidence that Netflix’s stock fell 40% following Hastings’ donation. According to Yahoo Finance, the stock is down only about 3% over the past five days as of July 30. We rate claims that Netflix’s stock tumbled after the company donated to Harris’ presidential campaign False. "
"July 30, 2024",JD Vance,Vice President Kamala Harris is “calling for an end to the child tax credit.”,pants-fire,"Vice President Kamala Harris has repeatedly expressed support for the child tax credit. The Biden administration approved the 2021 American Rescue Plan, which expanded the child tax credit that year to $3,600 per child younger than 6, and $3,000 per child ages 6 to 17. The current amount is $2,000 per child, up to age 16. The administration has pressured Congress to make the more generous credits permanent.","Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance defended his past remarks about childless women by falsely claiming that Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, wants to end a tax credit for parents. Vance has gotten a lot of backlash about a pair of interviews he gave in 2021, one in which he complained the U.S was being run by "" a bunch of childless cat ladies ,"" and another in which he said childless Americans should pay higher tax rates . Vance has since told Sirius XM radio host Megyn Kelly and Fox News that his comments were taken out of context. Then, the Ohio senator shifted to Harris. ""Why do we have the Harris campaign coming out this very morning, Megyn, and saying that we should not have the child tax credit, which lowers tax rates for parents of young children? It's because they have become antifamily and antikid,"" Vance told Kelly on July 26. He followed up with the similar claim in a July 28 interview with Fox News host Trey Gowdy. ""How did we get to this place where Kamala Harris is calling for an end to the child tax credit?"" Vance said. She isn’t. PolitiFact found no evidence that Harris has ever called to end the child tax credit. On the contrary, she supports it. The Biden-Harris administration expanded the tax credit in 2021, when the American Rescue Plan became law, and Harris has pushed Congress to make the credit permanent. We contacted Vance’s Senate office and the Trump campaign for comment but did not hear back by publication. Harris’ support of the child tax credit Congress established the child tax credit in 1997 to financially support families with children. The amount and age of eligibility have been increased and expanded multiple times, with bipartisan support, since 2001. The credit provides families up to $2,000 per child younger than 17. Taxpayers who don’t owe enough in taxes to benefit from the credit could receive a refund of up to $1,400, but not the full $2,000. Eligibility for the credit phases out at higher income levels — currently single filers making $200,000 a year or more, or $400,000 for joint filers. The American Rescue Plan, which passed Congress with slim Democratic majorities before President Joe Biden signed it into law in March 2021, increased the credit for the 2021 filing year. The measure expanded the credit to $3,600 per child younger than 6, and $3,000 per child ages 6 to 17. The credit was also made fully refundable, making households eligible to receive the full benefit. (The credit reverted in 2022 to the previous $2,000-per-child maximum.) Harris called the increased child tax credit ""one of the most important, one of the most impactful parts of the American Rescue Plan."" The tax credit helped lift 2.9 million children out of poverty in 2021, a Census Bureau paper found . Almost three-quarters of the children benefited from the 2021 expansion, the report said. The Biden administration has pushed to make the 2021 credit increase permanent, including it in the White House’s 2025 fiscal year budget blueprint. In January, Harris lauded the House for passing a bipartisan tax package that includes the child tax credit expansion. ""Good news: The Child Tax Credit bill is headed to the Senate,"" Harris posted Feb. 1 on X ""While @POTUS and I continue to fight for the full expanded Child Tax Credit, this bill should be passed quickly. President Biden is ready to sign it into law."" The bill has languished in the Senate, where some Republicans oppose the measure without revisions that limit the credits’ parameters; they’re calling for eliminating a ""look-back"" policy that would let taxpayers use a previous year’s income if it yielded a larger child tax credit. A Harris staff member's X post Other Republicans on social media echoed Vance’s quip about Harris and the child tax credit. The chatter stems from a report by the Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning news outlet, about a Harris staff member’s criticism of Vance on X . Before we explain further, no, a campaign staff member’s X post does not represent the presidential candidate’s policy. Here’s what happened. Ammar Moussa, the Harris campaign’s rapid response director, criticized Vance’s past remarks on parents benefiting from tax policy. Moussa shared an ABC News story about Vance’s 2021 remarks on ""The Charlie Kirk Show"" podcast. Vance said U.S. tax policy needed to ""reward the things that we think are good"" and ""punish the things that we think are bad."" Vance told Kirk, ""So, you talk about tax policy, let's tax the things that are bad and not tax the things that are good. If you are making $100,000, $400,000 a year and you've got three kids, you should pay a different, lower tax rate than if you are making the same amount of money and you don't have any kids. It's that simple."" Moussa wrote on X , ""JD Vance’s attacks on childless Americans is even vile. He called for HIGHER taxes on those without children."" The child tax credit effectively lowers taxes for families with children, so the Daily Caller and some Republicans framed Moussa’s claim as being against the credits. Moussa was responding to Vance’s case for parents paying a ""different, lower tax rate"" than nonparents. Our ruling Vance said Harris is ""calling on ending the child tax credit."" Harris has not called for this; she has repeatedly expressed support for the child tax credit. The Biden administration approved an increase of the credit in 2021 so it covered more children and awarded more money per child. The White House has lobbied Congress to make the pandemic-era benefit permanent. Vance’s claim that Harris has called to end something that she actually wants expanded is not only wrong, but ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!  "

PolitiFact couldn’t find this video’s origin, but some Facebook users commented that they had seen the video years ago , one said as far back as 2013. Questions over Venezuela’s election outcome In Venezuela, votes are counted in two ways. One way is via a digital count that is sent to the electoral authorities through encrypted phone lines. The other way involves printed ballots; machines in a voting site print a ballot confirming a person’s vote, then that ballot is put in a box. The machines also print a tabulation with all the registered votes at the end of the election. The ballots and tabulations must match to confirm the results from each polling site, according to the Observatorio Electoral Venezolano, a Venezuela-based nongovernmental organization that monitors and analyzes elections. After the July 28 election, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was in Tokyo, expressed concerns that the Venezuelan election result ""does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people."" ""It’s critical that every vote be counted fairly and transparently, that election officials immediately share information with the opposition and independent observers without delay, and that the electoral authorities publish the detailed tabulation of votes. The international community is watching this very closely and will respond accordingly,"" Blinken told reporters July 29. Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado claimed that the election results were fraudulent. (Edmundo González Urrutia replaced Machado as the opposition presidential candidate when the Maduro-controlled Supreme Tribunal of Justice banned Machado from running for any office for 15 years.) ""I mean this is not just another fraud, I mean this is grossly, grossly ignoring and violating popular sovereignty, there is no way they can explain and justify this, not with the information we have,"" Machado said , speaking in Spanish, July 29 to national and international media outlets. Machado said the election results delivered by the Venezuelan government were ""impossible,"" because they conflicted with the voting tabulations her team collected, which she said showed 6.2 million votes for González Urrutia and 2.8 million for Maduro. ""We have in our hands the voting tabulations that demonstrate our historic, categorical and mathematically irreversible triumph,"" González Urrutia said , speaking in Spanish, July 29. The New York Times reported July 28 that ""officials at some polling places refused to release printouts verifying the electronic vote count, and there were reports of voter intimidation and other irregularities."" NBC News also reported July 29 about voter intimidation and irregularities at voting centers during the election. Our ruling Social media posts claim that a video shows ""several masked men stormed a local voting station and stole the ballot boxes"" during Venezuela’s 2024 election. But the video shows men carrying air conditioning units. The Venezuelan opposition called the election results fraudulent and some news outlets have reported election irregularities at some voting sites. But this video doesn’t show stolen ballot boxes in Venezuela. We rate this claim False. "
"July 30, 2024",Donald Trump,Kamala Harris “wants to defund the police.”,barely-true,"Calls by some liberals to ""defund the police"" followed a police officer’s murder of George Floyd. ""Defund"" is not an official legal term and can mean anything from closing a police department to diverting some of its budget to social services. In 2020, then-Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., called for ""reimagining"" public safety. But she didn’t explicitly call for shuttering police departments. Harris has said police agencies are necessary and has called for more law enforcement funding.","Former President Donald Trump said Vice President Kamala Harris ""wants to be the president for savage criminals"" and that Democrats are at ""war"" with police. ""She wants to defund the police,"" Trump said during a July 24 rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, his first rally after Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee. ""Now she's pulled back on it."" Trump’s remarks were contradictory because he said ""wants"" — as in present tense, but also said Harris ""pulled back on it,"" as in a past action. He made similar remarks several times in the days following the rally. The movement to ""defund"" the police reached its height in summer 2020, following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. ""Defund"" is not an official legal term and can include closing a police department or diverting some of its budget to social services. With Harris’ new presidential bid, we wanted to examine her past and present position on defunding police departments. Both the Trump and Harris campaigns responded to our query with multiple citations of Harris statements , and we found many through our own research. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told PolitiFact that Harris ""ran on a platform dedicated to defunding the police"" and that ""there is no question that she will implement these horrible policies if she has the chance."" The Harris campaign said that she does not support police defunding (as her campaign told us in 2020 ) and pointed to statements in which she spoke in favor of police funding. Harris called for ""reimagining"" public safety in 2020 We did not find that Harris called for dissolving police departments . In 2020, she called for ""reimagining"" public safety and investing in other areas, such as education, but said that the country needed law enforcement. Many of Harris’ comments came shortly after Floyd’s murder and before Biden announced her in August 2020 as his running mate. In a June 2020 radio interview on the New York show ""Ebro in the Morning,"" One host asked Harris, ""Where do you stand on defund the police?"" Harris said, ""Defund the police, the issue behind it is we need to reimagine how we are creating safety. When you have many cities that have one-third of their entire city budget focused on policing, we know that is not the smart way and the best way or the right way to achieve safety. For too long, the status quo thinking has been you get more safety by putting more cops on the street. Well, that’s wrong."" Harris said suburban communities ""don’t have that patrol car, they don’t have those police walking those streets,"" but what they do have is well-funded schools, high homeownership rates, thriving small businesses and access to health care. ""This whole movement is about rightly saying we need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities,"" Harris said. In a June 2020 interview with the The New York Times , Harris was asked her thinking on defunding the police. She said, ""Well, it’s a concept. We do have to reimagine what public safety looks like."" But she added that ""We’re not going to get rid of the police. We all have to be practical. But let’s separate out these discussions."" A Trump campaign account in 2020 posted a clip on X of Harris saying that it is ""wrong-headed thinking to think that the only way to get communities to be safe is to put more police officers on the street. What we have to do, and what we will do, is reimagine public safety."" The full transcript of her September 2020 remarks shows that she said didn’t call for defunding police departments. She said safe communities also need investments in schools, health care and small businesses. The Trump campaign also pointed to Harris’ June 2020 comments praising Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos asked Harris whether she supported Garcetti’s proposal to take about $150 million from police and invest it in health initiatives and youth training. ""We've got to reexamine what we're doing with American taxpayer dollars and ask the question, ‘Are we getting the right return on our investment? Are we actually creating healthy and safe communities?’ And that's a legitimate conversation and it requires a really critical evaluation. And I applaud Eric Garcetti for doing what he's done."" Stephanopoulos asked, ""So, does it mean, bottom line, we need fewer police on the streets of America right now?"" Harris said that if the country invests in communities ""they will be healthy, they will be strong, and we won't have a need for militarization of police. Right? We have to stop that. We have to stop militarization of police. But that doesn't mean we get rid of police. Of course not."" In October 2020, we fact-checked then-Vice President Mike Pence’s claim that Harris would ""defund, dismantle, and dissolve police departments."" We rated that False . We found that when Harris was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019, her criminal justice platform did not mention defunding police departments. Her plan called for increasing funding for body cameras, mental health professionals, and ""officer safety and wellness."" In a June 2020 episode of ABC’s ""The View,"" host Meghan McCain asked Harris, ""Are you for defunding the police?"" After some back-and-forth about the definition, Harris repeated her stance about needing to ""reimagine"" public safety, review how public funding is allocated and invest in mental health, schools and job training. We also found examples of Harris saying she wants the public to have access to police. On Sept. 6, 2020, Harris said , ""I want to make sure that if a woman is raped, a child is molested, one human being murders another human being, that there will be a police officer that responds to that case and that there will be accountability and consequence for the offender."" When Harris joined the Biden presidential ticket, the campaign made it clear the running mates were not in favor of defunding. ""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not support defunding the police, and it is a lie to suggest otherwise,"" Sabrina Singh, Harris’ press secretary, told PolitiFact in October 2020 . ""Throughout her career, Sen. Harris has supported increasing funding to police departments and boosting funding for community policing."" Subhead: As vice president, Harris has supported law enforcement funding Harris supported giving federal funding to local or state law enforcement agencies when she was the San Francisco district attorney , California attorney general and U.S. senator . The Biden-Harris administration has backed funding for law enforcement . Biden’s fiscal year 2025 budget proposal called for $1.2 billion over five years to support law enforcement agencies and combat crime. Harris has supported police reform initiatives including the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act , which she co-sponsored as a senator. That legislation would not defund the police ; it would make it easier to sue officers and would require police to complete racial profiling training. Harris reiterated her support for that legislation following the July 6 death of Sonya Massey, an unarmed Black woman, who called 911 about a prowler and was shot and killed in her Illinois home by a police officer. Our ruling Trump said Harris ""wants to defund the police."" The Trump campaign points to statements by Harris in 2020 — not in 2024. Shortly after Floyd’s murder, Harris was asked about the ""defund the police"" movement and called for ""reimagining"" public safety. While in 2020 she didn’t explicitly call for getting rid of police departments, she did state support for reexamining police budgets and lauded a proposal by the Los Angeles mayor to shift part of the police budget to community initiatives. But one way that ""defund the police"" is interpreted is dissolving police departments. Harris did not go that far — she said police were necessary. She told The New York Times in June 2020 ""we’re not going to get rid of the police."" Where Trump veers into territory that makes this claim inaccurate is when he spoke in the present tense, although he did follow his sentence with the phrase ""now she's pulled back on it."" When he said that Harris ""wants"" to defund police that leaves voters with the impression that the vice president and presumed presidential nominee is now calling for defunding the police. She is not. We rate this statement Mostly False. PolitiFact Staff Writer Ranjan Jindal contributed to this fact-check. RELATED : Fact-checking Donald Trump’s rally in Charlotte, N.C. "

Former Vice President Mike Pence, who briefly ran for the Republican nomination before dropping out of the race in October, has publicly said several times he will not endorse former President Donald Trump. But some social media posts are claiming that Pence has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. ""Mike Pence endorsed Kamala Harris,"" said sticker text on a July 26 TikTok video . ""This man is a honest man. God Bless U!!"" We found other social media posts making the same claim . TikTok identified this video as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. ( Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with TikTok.) We found no public statements or news articles about Pence endorsing Harris in a search of his social media feeds , Google News and the Nexis news database. That’s because it didn’t happen, said Alison Holcomb, a spokesperson for Advancing American Freedom , a conservative advocacy organization Pence founded. The claim is ""absolutely false. He has not endorsed Kamala Harris, and has no plans to do so,"" Holcomb said. Pence on his X account reposted at least three X posts from Advancing American Freedom that directly criticized Harris since Biden dropped out of the race. One of the X posts said , ""‘More taxes, more regulation’ sums up the Biden-Harris administration. @KamalaHarris owns this record."" Pence has said he will not endorse Trump for president. He said in a March 15 interview on Fox News that ""it should come as no surprise that I will not be endorsing Donald Trump this year,"" citing several differences beyond his ""constitutional duties"" Jan. 6, 2021. Those included Trump’s position on confronting the national debt, the sanctity of life and forcing a sale of ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company. Pence said then, however, that he will focus on talking about a broad, mainstream conservative agenda and that he would not vote for President Joe Biden, who then was running for reelection. ""Like most Americans I’m going to keep my vote to myself,"" Pence said. ""I would never vote for Joe Biden, but how I vote when that curtain closes, that’ll be for me."" He reiterated his reasons for not endorsing Trump in a July 25 episode of the ""Indiana 250 Off the Record"" podcast. The interview was recorded before Biden dropped out of the race July 21 because he expressed hope that Biden would drop out after his poor debate performance. Pence again did not say who he would vote for. Pence later praised Biden’s decision to drop out in a July 22 X post . In a July 24 discussion at the Fund for American Studies Summer Law Fellows closing ceremony, Pence did not discuss Harris directly, but criticized her for not attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s July 24 address to Congress . Pence discussed his decision to fulfill his duties in Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, and said: ""There were some in a well-meaning way say I might choose to do what our vice president did today and that was have somebody else fill in for them in a joint session of Congress."" An audience member asked Pence what advice he had for getting power out of Washington, D.C., and back to state and local governments. ""Vote Republican,"" Pence replied.

"July 29, 2024",Donald Trump,Kamala Harris “supported abolishing ICE.”,false,"As a U.S. senator in 2018, Kamala Harris criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies, including a policy that led to family separations at the border. In that context, Harris said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s function should be reexamined and that ""we need to probably even think about starting from scratch."" But Harris didn’t say there shouldn’t be immigration enforcement. In 2018, Harris also said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had a role and should exist.","In a flurry of attacks against his likely 2024 presidential opponent, former President Donald Trump said Vice President Kamala Harris allowed millions of immigrants to illegally ""stampede"" across the border and supported eliminating a central immigration enforcement agency. ""Lyin’ Kamala supported abolishing ICE,"" Trump said July 24 at a Charlotte, North Carolina, campaign rally. Trump, who pilloried several parts of Harris’ record, was referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency in charge of detaining and deporting immigrants who are illegally in the United States. In spring 2018, the ""abolish ICE"" movement drew attention after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York won her House primary and said it was ""time to abolish"" the agency. A small number of Democratic lawmakers or candidates supported the ""abolish ICE"" movement as a protest against Trump policies. Congress never abolished Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Trump and Harris campaigns responded to our query about Trump’s rally claim with multiple citations of Harris statements; we found many more through our own research. There is no record of Harris saying she would ""abolish ICE,"" a specific phrase that others like Ocasio-Cortez have used. And in 2019, when asked point-blank if she supports abolishing the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Harris said no. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told PolitiFact that Harris ""ran on a platform dedicated to defunding the police and abolishing ICE, and there is no question that she will implement these horrible policies if she has the chance."" Harris criticized Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2018, but also said it had a role Harris, as a California senator, criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies, including a deterrence policy that led to the separation of children and parents who arrived at the border illegally. In a March 2018 MSNBC interview , Harris said Immigration and Customs Enforcement should exist to deport people who commit serious and violent crimes, including rape, murder and child molestation. ""So, yes, ICE has a purpose. ICE has a role, ICE should exist,"" Harris said. ""But let’s not abuse the power. Let’s not extend it to areas that were not — that are not posing a threat to the safety and the public safety of these communities, especially when we know that these federal agencies have limited resources to do their core job."" The Trump campaign pointed to a June 2018 MSNBC interview in which host Kasie Hunt asked Harris whether she agreed with the calls to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Harris: ""Listen, I think there is no question that we’ve got to critically reexamine ICE and its role and the way it is being administered and the work it is doing. And we need to probably even think about starting from scratch because there’s a lot that is wrong with the way that it is conducting itself and we need to deal with that."" Hunt: ""What do you think should be the alternative to ICE?"" Harris: ""Well, first of all, I don't think that the government should be in the position of separating families and that is clearly what is part of what's happening at ICE and DHS. You look at what’s happening again in terms of how they are conducting their perspective on asylum seekers. That is a real problem and is contrary to all the spirit and the reason we even have the asylum rules and laws in the first place. So, their mission I think is very much in question and has to be reexamined."" On ABC’s ""The View"" in 2019, Harris was asked whether she would abolish the Department of Homeland Security, which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ""No, I would not,"" Harris said. She called the department ""dysfunctional"" and said the government needs to ""fix it, but I do not believe in getting rid of it."" Harris’ other comments do not prove she wanted to abolish the agency The Trump campaign also pointed to other Harris statements that were critical of Trump’s immigration enforcement policies , but none of the comments go as far as Trump claimed in his remarks. In 2019, Harris called raids on workplaces the Trump administration’s ""campaign of terror"" that she said would make immigrants afraid to go to work. Harris co-sponsored legislation to block Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests at schools, hospitals, and religious institutions without prior approval and exigent circumstances. The Washington Post in 2020 reported that Harris was among the politicians who wanted to restructure the agency, but not abolish it. NPR reached similar conclusions in 2018. The Trump campaign also pointed to a 2008 New York Times article written when Harris was San Francisco district attorney. But this article does not address Harris’ stance on Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s existence; it said San Francisco was assuring immigrants who were in the country illegally that the city would not report them to federal immigration authorities. In the article, Harris said criminals tend to tell their victims who are in the country illegally that they will be treated as criminals because of their immigration status. Harris’ 2019 presidential primary immigration platform did not call for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She called to overhaul immigration enforcement policies and focus enforcement on increasing public safety. The Biden-Harris ticket’s 2020 campaign platform also did not call for abolishing the agency. In February 2024, Harris backed bipartisan legislation that included border enforcement. The bill sought to limit the number of asylum seekers and included funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to increase detention capacity and removal flights and hire more personnel. That proposal died amid Republican opposition. Our ruling Trump said Harris ""supported abolishing ICE."" It’s clear that Harris opposed, and opposes, many of Trump’s immigration positions. And she called for an end to the hard-line tactics that had been used by the administration. But she never said she would abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In fact, she said the opposite.

Because the camera was pointing up at Biden, it made him look taller. In the video, Biden was standing a few steps in front of first lady Jill Biden, making him appear bigger because he was closer to the camera. In another photo from that day, the Bidens were standing beside each other, and their height difference was less exaggerated.","After President Joe Biden addressed the nation July 24 about his decision to exit the 2024 presidential race, Biden walked out into the White House’s Rose Garden standing tall. But some social media users claimed the president looked too tall. A July 25 Instagram post shared a video of Biden walking from the Oval Office to the Rose Garden, with first lady Jill Biden and other Biden family members standing behind him. The video’s narrator said, ""People are saying Joe Biden looks a lot taller."" The Instagram video then showed photos of Joe and Jill Biden together to note their height difference, implying that it wasn’t as big in those instances. ""There’s obviously something going on here,"" the narrator said, flashing back to the Rose Garden and noting that Jill Biden was wearing heels. This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Screengrab from Instagram) We saw the same claim circulating on X , where the footage of Biden was being used to prop up the false conspiracy theory that Biden employs a body double for public appearances. This conspiracy gained traction ahead of the June 27 presidential debate. PolitiFact and other news outlets have repeatedly fact-checked false claims that Biden employs a body double or that video footage shows a masked impersonator instead of the real Biden. Social media users have also speculated that Biden’s recent appearances, including a July 22 phone call with Vice President Kamala Harris, have been generated with artificial intelligence. We found no credible evidence to support this claim. Also, people stop growing during adolescence . So, it’s biologically improbable that Biden, as an 81-year-old, grew taller over the few days he isolated in his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home following his COVID-19 diagnosis July 17. Biden’s official health summary from February says he is 6 feet tall. So, if Biden doesn’t have a body double, and he didn’t have miraculous growth spurt, what explains Biden’s taller appearance in the Rose Garden video? It’s the camera angle. Biden was standing atop the steps by the colonnade outside of the Oval Office, and the cameraperson was in the Rose Garden. So, Biden stood in an elevated position compared with the person filming. Angling a camera up at people can make them look taller in photos and videos. (Left image is a screengrab from Instagram. Right photo is courtesy of The Associated Press.) Joe Biden also appears taller in the video because he is standing a few steps in front of Jill Biden, and people closer to the camera will naturally look bigger. Another photo of the Bidens , which was taken just before they walked out of the Oval Office and toward the Rose Garden, shows less of an apparent height difference because they are standing side by side. We rate the claim that a video shows Biden was taller when he emerged from a July 24 Oval Office speech Pants on Fire! "

Comentarios similares surgieron en las elecciones presidenciales de 2008, cuando el entonces senador Barack Obama se postuló por primera vez a la Casa Blanca. Algunos cuestionaron, sin fundamento, si realmente había nacido en Hawai. Donald Trump sostuvo esta falsa línea de ataque antes de lanzar su propia campaña presidencial. Otros candidatos presidenciales del partido republicano se han enfrentado a un escrutinio similar. Fue el caso del senador Ted Cruz , republicano por Texas (nacido en Canadá de madre estadounidense).

PolitiFact desmintió estas afirmaciones sobre Harris en otras ocasiones. Pero salieron nuevamente a la luz pública, después de que Harris anunciara su intención de presentarse a las elecciones presidenciales. Las analizamos de nuevo.

Se casaron, pero se separaron cuando Harris tenía cinco años, escribió Harris en su libro de 2019, "" Las verdades que sostenemos "". El Bay Area News Group publicó una copia del certificado de nacimiento de Harris en 2020, junto a un artículo del San Jose Mercury News. Este muestra que Donald Harris nació en Jamaica y Gopalan nació en la India. Pero no indica su estatus de ciudadanía.

Gopalan, que falleció de cáncer en 2009, se dedicó a la investigación del cáncer de mama y su trabajo la llevó por todo el mundo. No hemos encontrado pruebas de que obtuviera la nacionalidad estadounidense. Gopalan se trasladó a Montreal para trabajar como profesora cuando Harris estaba en la escuela secundaria. Más tarde, Harris dejó Montreal para asistir a la Universidad Howard en Washington, D.C., según su libro.

""Como persona nacida en Estados Unidos, Harris es una 'ciudadana por nacimiento'"", dijo Bulman-Pozen.

La 14ª Enmienda establece en parte que: ""Todas las personas nacidas o naturalizadas en Estados Unidos, y sujetas a su jurisdicción, son ciudadanos de Estados Unidos y del estado en el que residan"". Bulman-Pozen dijo que ha habido debates sobre la elegibilidad de las personas nacidas fuera de EE.UU. de padres ciudadanos estadounidenses, como fue el caso de McCain. Pero dijo que ""no hay ningún argumento plausible de que alguien nacido en EE.UU. no sea un ciudadano"". ""Si hubiera alguna duda, la sección uno de la 14ª Enmienda confirma la norma estadounidense de la ciudadanía por derecho de nacimiento"", dijo Bulman-Pozen.

The official nominee will be chosen either in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention that starts Aug. 19 or at the convention itself. States set deadlines for receiving the names of presidential nominees so that ballots can be printed. Those deadlines are generally after the convention.,"After President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race July 21, some social media users claimed his late announcement leaves no opportunity for some states to change their ballots to accommodate another candidate’s name. An Instagram post said there are nine states ""where Biden’s name can’t be removed and no one can be added. That’s over 130 electoral votes in the toilet."" It lists these states: Alabama, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington. The post attributed the information to Grok, which is X’s AI chatbot. This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. It’s wrong to say that Biden’s name can’t be ""removed"" because it hasn’t yet been placed on ballots. Biden was the presumptive nominee — not the official nominee. Election officials in the states listed in the Instagram post have said in written statements and in emails to PolitiFact that their deadlines for the party to submit its nominees’ names for the ballot have not yet passed. Democrats are expected to choose their nominee at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Aug. 19 to 22, or likely earlier — perhaps Aug. 7, in a virtual roll call vote. Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who appears likely to get the nomination . Once that happens, the nominees’ names will be forwarded to state election officials, who will place them on the ballot. Because there currently is no formal nominee, and because state ballot deadlines haven’t passed yet, legal experts say there’s no problem listing someone other than Biden on ballots. But Republicans may file legal challenges, and the U.S. Supreme Court could have the final say. David Becker, executive director of The Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonprofit that works with election officials, wrote on X that statements that Democrats can’t ""substitute"" a nominee for Biden in several states is ""100% false."" ""Biden is not ON the ballot in any state,"" Becker wrote. ""Dems don’t have a nominee yet. Once they do, after delegates vote, that person will be on the ballot in every state."" State election officials told us that there is still time to place a name other than Biden on ballot Alabama : Secretary of State Wes Allen said in a statement July 21 that ​​major parties have until Aug. 23 to formally announce their presidential and vice presidential candidates to the secretary of state’s office, which will certify the candidates by Aug. 28. Alabama law had initially set an Aug. 15 deadline — 82 days before the election — to confirm candidates. But because this was before the DNC, the state House unanimously passed legislation in May to extend the deadline. Indiana : Secretary of State Diego Morales issued a statement July 22 confirming the Sept. 10 deadline for parties to submit candidates. Michigan : Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a July 22 statement that presidential candidates appear on the ballot as a result of the party nominating conventions’ outcomes. Under state law, the nominees’ names must be delivered to Michigan’s State Department within one business day of the party convention’s conclusion, meaning an Aug. 26 deadline. Minnesota : The deadline for parties to submit presidential and vice-presidential candidates to the secretary of state’s office is Aug. 26 — 71 days before the general election. New Mexico : Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver on July 22 confirmed the state’s ballot deadline of Aug. 27. ""The ballot deadline has not passed in New Mexico,"" Toulouse Oliver said. Ohio : The Ohio Legislature changed the ballot deadline to Sept. 1. Although the previous deadline was Aug. 7, the House passed legislation in May that extended the date. Pennsylvania : Under the Pennsylvania election code, the presidential and vice presidential nominees selected at the Democratic National Convention will appear on the general election ballot as the Democratic candidates for president and vice president. At least 70 days before the election, the secretary must provide the counties with names of all known candidates. This year, that date is Aug. 27. Texas : As our partners at The Dallas Morning News reported and we confirmed, Texas state law sets a deadline of 74 days before the election for a candidate to withdraw and 71 days for the party to provide a replacement. That means that the Texas Democratic Party has until Aug. 26 to submit the names of its nominees. Washington : According to state law, presidential candidates must be certified for the November ballot by Aug. 20 , which falls before the Democratic National Convention. But Washington secretary of state Spokesperson Derrick Nunnally told PolitiFact that state officials would accept a letter from the Democratic National Committee attesting to the party’s alternate nominee. ""This possibility was provided to accommodate the Democratic party’s stated nomination schedule after reviewing both state law and precedent from 2020,"" Nunnally said, noting that in 2020 both parties submitted ""provisional nominations"" because of a misalignment of the convention schedules and law deadline. Our ruling An Instagram post said that there are nine states ""where Biden’s name can’t be removed and no one can be added. That’s over 130 electoral votes in the toilet."" But there is nothing to ""remove"" Biden’s name from because he was the presumptive nominee, not the official nominee. After the Democrats formally choose their official nominee — either at their Aug. 19 convention or before — state officials will receive those names to place them on their states’ ballots. There is still time to add the name of the Democratic nominee. We rate this statement False. PolitiFact Staff Writer Madison Czopek contributed to this fact-check.

It held its presidential primary earlier this year, on March 12. President Joe Biden won Washington’s Democratic presidential primary in March, according to the certified election results. Biden has since dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Under Washington law, presidential candidates must be certified for the November ballot by Aug. 20, which falls before the Democratic nominee could be formally elected at the Democratic National Convention. Washington’s secretary of state will accept a letter from the Democratic National Committee attesting to the party’s alternate nominee, a spokesperson said.","Shortly after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, some social media users claimed his late departure presented an opportunity for former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, to win historically ""blue"" states . ""Trump could win 50 states,"" read a screenshot of a July 21 X post shared on Instagram . ""Here is a funny scenario that no one is talking about. The state of Washington has already sent out their ballots."" The X post continued, making claims about how votes for Biden, Harris and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent candidate, would be counted. The Instagram post added that ""states like Washington that weren’t up for grabs are now on the radar"" for Trump. This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Screenshot from Instagram) The claim that Washington state has already ""sent out"" ballots for the November 2024 presidential election is inaccurate. Every person registered to vote in Washington is mailed a ballot at least 18 days before an election. The state’s next election is an Aug. 6 statewide primary election. That August ballot includes candidates for the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, statewide executive offices, the state Legislature, state court positions, local races and local ballot measures, according to the secretary of state’s website . Washington held its presidential primary election separately, on March 12 . Biden won the Democratic primary and Trump won the Republican primary, according to the certified election results . For the state’s August primary, county election offices were required to mail out ballots by July 19, according to the secretary of state’s website . The website noted: ""The August Primary does not include President/Vice President."" Derrick Nunnally, spokesperson for Washington’s secretary of state, confirmed: ""Washington’s ballots for the Aug. 6 state primary are out; these do not include the Presidential election."" Although Harris has enough support from delegates to win the Democratic presidential nomination, delegates will not vote for the nominee until August . Washington state’s Democratic party has also expressed support for Harris. In a July 21 statement on X, party Chair Shasti Conrad called on Biden’s delegates to support Harris. ""Vice President Kamala Harris has spent the last four years championing and pushing President Biden’s successful agenda,"" Conrad said . ""She knows this work is heart-led work and her effective advancement of the Biden-Harris administration’s priorities position her as the only viable alternative to President Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket."" Under Washington law, presidential candidates must be certified for the November ballot by Aug. 20 , which falls during the Democratic National Convention scheduled for Aug. 19-22. Democratic leaders are seeking to streamline efforts through a virtual nominee selection process that would end by Aug. 7, multiple outlets reported . In April, Washington officials said they would accept a letter from the Democratic National Committee attesting that Biden would be the party’s nominee. Nunnally told PolitiFact July 22 that the secretary of state’s office would still accept a letter from the Democratic National Committee attesting to the party’s alternate nominee. ""This possibility was provided to accommodate the Democratic party’s stated nomination schedule after reviewing both state law and precedent from 2020,"" Nunnally said, noting that in 2020 both parties submitted ""provisional nominations"" due to a misalignment of the convention schedules and law deadline.

This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Screengrab from Threads) Although it’s correct that Trump, then a private citizen and now the Republican presidential nominee, donated to Harris’ attorney general campaign, the post misleads about what Harris did with the money. Following his 2011 donation, Trump gave an additional $1,000 to Harris’ campaign in February 2013. Trump’s daughter Ivanka also donated $2,000 to Harris’ campaign in June 2014, California campaign finance records show. A spokesperson for Harris’ 2020 presidential campaign told McClatchy in 2019 that Harris donated the $6,000 from Donald Trump to ""a nonprofit that advocates for civil and human rights for Central Americans.""

When we contacted Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign for more information, a spokesperson referred us to the McClatchy report. The article didn’t say what Harris did with the $2,000 from Ivanka Trump. After Harris became Biden’s running mate in 2020, a spokesperson for Biden’s presidential campaign told The Washington Post that Harris did not solicit these donations from Donald Trump. Donating the money from Trump to a nonprofit is not the same as returning it. We rate this claim False. "
"July 22, 2024",Instagram posts,Kamala Harris “is not eligible to hold the office of president” because her parents were non-citizens.,pants-fire,"Vice President Kamala Harris was born in 1964 in Oakland, California. The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that people born in the United States are citizens. Only natural-born citizens are eligible to be president, Article II of the Constitution says. Harris, born in the U.S., meets that standard, legal experts said.","Birtherism is back, it seems, now that support is coalescing around Vice President Kamala for the Democratic presidential nomination after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her. ""Unless proven with court documents at the time of Kamala’s birth, her parents were not U.S. citizens,"" said text under a copy of Harris’ birth certificate shared July 21 on Instagram. ""They were foreign students. At the time of her birth, she was the daughter of non-citizens. This makes her an anchor baby. She is not eligible to hold the office of president."" We found similar claims shared on other social media platforms following Biden’s July 21 announcement. This Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Claims that politicians aren’t eligible to be president began in earnest in the 2008 presidential election cycle when then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., first ran for the White House. Some people baselessly questioned whether he was really born in Hawaii — a false line of attack later fueled by Donald Trump before Trump launched his own presidential campaign. Past Republican presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas, (born in Canada to a U.S. citizen mother) and Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz., (born in the Panama Canal Zone to two U.S. citizens) have faced similar scrutiny. PolitiFact has debunked these claims about Harris before, but because the claims surfaced again following her July 21 announcement that she intends to seek the presidency, we’re taking a fresh look. Harris’ parents, Donald Harris and Shyamala Gopalan, met while they were students at the University of California, Berkeley. They married but separated when Harris was 5 years old, Harris wrote in her 2019 book, "" The Truths we Hold: An American Journey ."" A copy of Harris’ birth certificate posted online in August 2020 by the Bay Area News Group to accompany a San Jose Mercury News article shows Donald Harris was born in Jamaica and Gopalan was born in India. It does not show their citizenship status. Donald Harris’ biography at Stanford University, where he was an economics professor, shows that, at some point, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. Gopalan, who died of cancer in 2009, became a breast cancer researcher whose work took her around the world. We could find no evidence she became a U.S. citizen. Gopalan moved to Montreal for a teaching position when Harris was in middle school. Kamala Harris later left Montreal to attend Howard University in Washington, D.C., her book said. Harris’ birth certificate shows she was born in 1964 at a hospital in Oakland, California, in Alameda County. Legal experts told PolitiFact that’s all that’s needed to show Harris is eligible to be president. Her parents’ citizenship status when she was born isn’t a factor. (Instagram screenshot) ""Yes, she is unquestionably eligible,"" Columbia University law professor Jessica Bulman-Pozen said. She pointed to the U.S. Constitution’s Article 2 , which states that: ""No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President."" ""As someone born in the United States, Harris is a ‘natural born citizen,’"" Bulman-Pozen said. University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt said the Constitution’s 14th Amendment ""is very clear that people born in the U.S. are citizens."" ""The only exception is for children of foreign diplomats, who are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States."" The 14th Amendment states that: ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."" Bulman-Pozen said there have been debates about the eligibility of people born outside the U.S. to U.S.-citizen parents, as McCain was, but said ""there is no plausible argument that someone born in the U.S. is not a natural born citizen."" ""If there was any doubt, section one of the 14th Amendment confirms the U.S. norm of birthright citizenship,"" she said. Harris was born in California, which means she is a natural-born citizen. Therefore, we rate the claim that Harris is ineligible to be president because her parents were not U.S. citizens at her time of birth as Pants on Fire! "
"July 18, 2024",Donald Trump Jr.,"After being shot at a Milwaukee rally in 1912, former President Teddy Roosevelt “finished his speech and he kept fighting.”",mostly-true,"When former President Donald Trump headed to Milwaukee after an attempt on his life at a rally in Pennsylvania, conservatives sought to tie him to a former president who was shot in the city. In 1912, Teddy Roosevelt was shot leaving the Gilpatrick Hotel in Milwaukee on his way to give a speech. Historical reports show his metal glasses case in his coat pocket, and a thick copy of his prepared remarks, slowed the bullet. Roosevelt went on to deliver a lengthy speech. He wasn’t shot during the rally itself, as Trump was — rather beforehand, and he decided to go speak anyway. Though Donald Trump Jr. got that detail wrong in his attempt to relate the incident to what happened to his father, he’s largely right about the story.","When former President Donald Trump arrived in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention, comparisons to the plight of another storied former president were plentiful. Trump, the GOP nominee to take on President Joe Biden this fall, flew to Wisconsin after a rally in Pennsylvania during which he was shot in the ear with a bullet that was meant to take his life . More than a century ago, former Republican President Teddy Roosevelt was visiting Milwaukee for a rally when he was shot and injured in an assassination attempt . That attempted assassination isn’t very well known, but it’s been a talking point at the convention this week as conservatives seek to tie Trump to Roosevelt, who carefully cultivated a manly image. Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., referred to it during his Wednesday night speech at the convention, broadcast to millions of viewers across the country. ""At a political rally less than 1 mile from where we stand tonight, Teddy Roosevelt was struck by a would-be assassin’s bullet,"" Trump Jr. said. ""But he didn’t quit, either. He finished his speech and kept fighting."" Trump Jr. has the general idea right, but is off on a few details — which make the story of what happened to Roosevelt all the more interesting. Roosevelt shot before speech; copy of remarks, glasses case slowed the bullet Roosevelt was touring the Midwest when he visited Milwaukee in 1912, campaigning for a third term as president because he was unhappy with the work of then-President William Howard Taft, according to a Library of Congress article on the incident . He arrived in the city Oct. 14, 1912. He dined at the Gilpatrick Hotel — now the site of the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee — then set out to head to the Milwaukee Auditorium, now Miller High Life Theatre, to give his speech. Outside the hotel, he was shot by a man named John Schrank from New York City, who had followed Roosevelt through several states to attempt to kill him. Roosevelt fell back and the bullet pierced his chest, according to the Library of Congress article — but not before it was slowed by a metal eyeglasses case and a 50-page copy of his speech folded in half. After Schrank was taken into custody, Roosevelt was driven to the auditorium — about a block away — and delivered an hour-plus speech to the crowd with the bullet still inside him, using his bloodied shirt as a symbol of his resilience. He was then rushed to the hospital. So, although Trump was actively delivering his speech at a rally when he was shot, Roosevelt wasn’t in the exact same situation, as Trump Jr. claimed. He was shot before his speech and decided to give it anyway. (Granted, the security procedures for protecting a former president after an assassination attempt were likely much different in 1912 than they are today.) The attempt on Roosevelt’s life was one event that shaped his image as a ""self-made cowboy soldier,"" History.com describes , who ""embodied a new ideal of manliness."" Republicans have been pitching themselves for years as ""the party of manliness, the alphas, of the tough ones,"" American University assistant professor of public communications Kurt Braddock told The Washington Post . Drawing parallels between Trump and Roosevelt, Braddock said, feeds that idea. Our ruling Trump Jr., in connecting the attempted assassination of his father to the one of Roosevelt in Milwaukee in 1912, said Roosevelt was struck at a political rally, ""finished his speech and kept fighting."" It wasn’t midrally, as happened to Trump, but Roosevelt certainly did press on, cementing a forceful image of himself that Trump supporters seek to have the public remember. Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That fits here. "
"July 18, 2024",Kamala Harris,"""Unlike Mike Pence, (JD) Vance said he would have carried out Trump's plan to overturn the 2020 election.""",mostly-true,"Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance told ABC News in February 2024 that if he had been vice president in 2020, he would have told states, ""we needed to have multiple slates of electors."" That’s in line with what former President Donald Trump and his allies wanted to do. Vance has said in interviews that the election was ""stolen"" from Trump.","Vice President Kamala Harris said in a campaign video that former President Donald Trump’s pick for vice president will be ""loyal only to Trump, not to our country."" Harris said in the video that the Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, will ""rubber stamp"" Trump’s ""extreme agenda."" She added, ""Unlike Mike Pence, Vance said he would have carried out Trump's plan to overturn the 2020 election."" After losing the 2020 election, Trump and his allies sought to enlist help from state elected officials, Justice Department officials and then-Vice President Mike Pence to stay in office. Trump allies put forward their own slates of ""alternate"" electors to sign certificates declaring that Trump won battleground states that he actually lost. Trump critics have referred to them as ""fake electors"" and state prosecutors have criminally charged dozens of them. On Jan. 6, 2021, Pence refused to consider Trump’s alternate slates of electors. Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 loss happened before Vance was a senator, so Vance was not in position to vote to accept the electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2021. Vance won the U.S. Senate race in 2022. We examined how Vance has addressed this issue in media interviews and found that he hasn’t directly said he would have overturned the election. But comments he’s made that Congress should have considered multiple slates of electors align with plans by Trump and his allies to have an alternate slate of electors vote for Trump. Vance has also said the 2020 election was ""stolen"" from Trump. Vance: ‘Multiple’ slates of electors should have been considered When Congress meets to certify the election results, the vice president opens the envelopes from each state that contain the results that determine which candidate received that state’s electoral votes. These results, presented in official certificates, have been signed and sealed. The vice president opens the envelopes and hands them to four members from the House and Senate who read the results aloud. At the end, the vice president announces the final tally. Pence has said that Trump asked him to overturn the election by returning or rejecting votes cast for Biden. Pence said he had no authority to do that. In a February 2024 interview, ABC’s ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos asked Vance how he would have handled the election results if he had been vice president in 2020. Vance said there should have been multiple slates of electors. In 2022, Congress clarified the Electoral Count Act to say the vice president’s role is strictly ""ministerial"" and binds Congress to accept a single slate of electors from each state. Stephanopoulos asked Vance, ""Had you been vice president on Jan. 6, would you have certified the election results?"" Vance said he thought there were problems with the 2020 election, including changes in Pennsylvania balloting rules. (In October 2019, Pennsylvania’s General Assembly passed Act 77 to permit no-excuse, mail-in voting.) ""So, litigating which slate of electors were legitimate I think is fundamentally the political solution to the problems that existed in 2020,"" Vance said. Stephanopoulos again asked: ""Would you have certified the election results had you been vice president?"" Vance said, ""If I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there. That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that's what we should have done."" Stephanopoulos said to Vance, ""So, it's very clear, you would have done what Donald Trump asked you to do there, not what Vice President Mike Pence did."" Vance said, ""It’s not about what Donald Trump asks somebody to do. It's about, what do we do when you have a problem like what happened in 2020? How do you respond to it? How does the political system respond to this?"" When Vance ran for U.S. Senate, he told Time magazine in a July 2021 interview that he thought the 2020 election was ""unfair."" ""I think Josh Hawley did the right thing,"" he said. Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, led the Senate charge against Congress accepting Joe Biden’s victory — a position he kept after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Much of Hawley’s argument was based on changes to Pennsylvania mail-in voting . Vance: the 2020 election was ‘stolen’ from Trump Courts , state election officials, including Georgia Republicans, and Trump administration officials said that the 2020 election results were legitimate. By contrast, Vance has claimed that people voted illegally ""on a large-scale basis."" During a Senate primary debate in 2022 , Vance said, ""I say it all the time: I think the election was stolen from Trump."" Weeks before the 2022 midterms, the The Cincinnati Enquirer asked Vance, ""Do you believe President Joe Biden was legitimately elected in 2020?"" Vance said, ""I mean, he's the president, right? He is certainly the legitimate president of the United States. The thing that I've always said here, and I'll repeat to you, is, ‘Was the election in 2020 free and fair, was it above board?’ My answer is no, I really don't think that it was."" In a June 2024 interview with Ross Douthat, a conservative opinion columnist at The New York Times, Vance said there should have been an effort to provide alternate slates of electors ""to force us to have that debate."" He also said that ""challenging elections and questioning the legitimacy of elections"" is part of the democratic process. CNN’s Dana Bash asked Vance on May 12 whether he would commit to accepting the 2024 election results. ""Certainly, if we have a free and fair election, I will accept the results,"" Vance said. Bash asked Vance, ""Even if Joe Biden wins?"" Vance said, ""Sure. If it's a free and fair election, I will accept the results, Dana, whoever wins."" Our ruling Harris said, ""Unlike Mike Pence, Vance said he would have carried out Trump's plan to overturn the 2020 election."" Vance hasn’t said exactly that. But he has said he supported Trump’s plan to present Congress with alternate slates of electors on Jan. 6, 2021, that showed Trump winning battleground states he actually had lost. Vance’s statement showed he supported pursuing a path that would have allowed Congress to challenge Biden’s victory. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

"July 17, 2024",Jon Stewart,"Milwaukee's Marcus Performing Arts Center – where 'The Daily Show' had been scheduled – “was originally located in the ‘soft perimeter,’ they called it, security-wise” but “was shifted, understandably so, to the ‘hard perimeter.’”",false,"The RNC’s security ""hard zone,"" where people need credentials to enter, encompasses the convention’s main buildings: Fiserv Forum, the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, and the Baird Center. Following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, the director of the Secret Service said her agency’s security plan had been ""strengthened"" but that there were no changes to the perimeters of the security zone. At the time that ""The Daily Show"" canceled its Milwaukee trip, there were still questions about whether those security perimeters could change. But by the time Stewart was addressing his viewers about the canceled trip, there were no stated changes to the perimeters. The Marcus Center, where he was set to host his show, was not, and still is not, in the security ""hard zone"" as Stewart claimed.","Comedian and late-night show host Jon Stewart was set to bring his popular program , ""The Daily Show,"" to Milwaukee this week during the 2024 Republican National Convention. That plan changed when former President Donald Trump, this year’s Republican nominee for president, was shot in the ear at a July 13 rally in Pennsylvania in an attempted assassination. The next day, ""The Daily Show'' sent emails to ticketholders letting them know the show was off ""due to logistical issues and the evolving situation in Milwaukee."" Stewart opened his July 16 show by explaining to viewers why he wasn’t in Milwaukee as planned. Because of the attempt on Trump’s life, Stewart said, the Marcus Performing Arts Center — where they were supposed to host the show — ""was originally located in the ‘soft perimeter,’ they called it, security-wise"" but ""was shifted, understandably so, to the ‘hard perimeter.’"" ""You really don’t want to be in the ‘hard perimeter,’"" he joked afterward, adding that because of the security measures around the theater, his team felt they couldn’t put on their shows effectively. But his explanation of those perimeters wasn’t quite right. The boundaries of the perimeter did not change following the assassination attempt, and the Marcus Center isn’t in the hard security zone. Let’s take a look at the details. Marcus Center isn’t in the credential-only security ‘hard zone’ So, where exactly is the ""hard zone,"" known as such because it requires credentials to enter? It surrounds Fiserv Forum, the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena and the Baird Center, the main spaces where the convention will take place. It stretches from West McKinley Avenue on the north to just past West Wisconsin Avenue to the south, encompasses Pere Marquette Park on the east side and stretches past North Lovell Street on the west. A wider security footprint, which pedestrians can enter freely but vehicles must enter through a security checkpoint, stretches from the Milwaukee River past North 9th Street and from West Clybourn Street to West Cherry Street. The Marcus Center is on North Water Street, on the other side of the Milwaukee River. Its box office is open by phone only during the week, and ticketing windows are closed, communications and media relations manager Jennifer Han told the Journal Sentinel . Its parking structure is open for parking during the RNC, but is accessible only from Water Street or Edison Street because of a security checkpoint on State Street. Although it made some adjustments to accommodate for security, Han confirmed July 17 that the Marcus Center is not within the security perimeter of the convention. Although Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said July 15 that the agency had ""strengthened"" its security plan for the convention following the attempt on Trump’s life, no specific changes to the security zone were announced. Han did say that at the time ""The Daily Show"" decided to cancel, ""there were still questions"" about whether the security perimeter would be shifting because of the attempted assassination of Trump in Pennsylvania. So, at that time, Stewart and his team might not have known whether their chosen venue would become off-limits to members of the public who bought tickets to the show. But at the time he was airing his reasons Tuesday night for canceling his Milwaukee trip, there were no changes to the security zone – making his statement off-base. Our ruling Stewart claimed that the Marcus Performing Arts Center, where his team was set to tape episodes of ""The Daily Show"" during the RNC, was originally located in the ""soft"" security perimeter but ""was shifted, understandably so, to the ‘hard perimeter.’"" Though there were questions at the time ""The Daily Show"" pulled out of the trip to Milwaukee about whether the security perimeter would change, it did not ultimately change. The Marcus Center was not and still is not inside the ""hard perimeter"" as Stewart claimed. We rate this claim False. "
"July 17, 2024",Kari Lake,"“Just last week, Ruben Gallego voted to let the millions of people who poured into our country illegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election.”",false,"House Republicans passed a bill in July that would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. Most Democrats voted against the bill. Federal law for decades has already banned noncitizen voting in federal elections. Noncitizen voting is statistically rare, but some Republicans have made it a campaign issue in 2024.","Kari Lake, a U.S. Senate candidate from Arizona, joined the chorus of oft-repeated falsehoods this year about noncitizen voting during her speech at the Republican National Convention. ""Just last week, Ruben Gallego voted to let the millions of people who poured into our country illegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election,"" Lake said on the second night of the convention in Milwaukee. Gallego, a Democratic U.S. representative, and Lake are expected to face each other in the U.S. Senate race. The Arizona primary is July 30. Lake’s statement is a distortion of Gallego’s position. Lake referred to the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act , which passed the House by a 221-198 vote July 10, largely with Republican support. It’s not expected to pass the Democratic-led Senate. Gallego joined nearly all Democrats in voting against the legislation. This bill, supported by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La ., requires people to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. By opposing the bill, Gallego is not voting to allow immigrants who crossed the border illegally to vote in the federal election in November. When Gallego voted against the bill, he said in a statement , ""Of course only U.S. citizens should vote."" Gallego said the bill would create obstacles for Arizonans to vote because of the requirements to provide the documentary proof of citizenship. In 1996, Congress banned voting by noncitizens, which includes people legally and illegally in the U.S., in federal elections. ""It is already illegal for noncitizens to register or vote in federal elections,"" Wendy Weiser, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU school of law, said in an email to PolitiFact. ""The SAVE Act would not change that fact."" In June, Gallego introduced the Voting Clarity Act , which would require Customs and Border Protection officers to advise migrants seeking asylum that they are ineligible to vote in federal elections. Voting in federal elections by noncitizens ""is already a crime several times over,"" said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of voting rights at the Brennan Center in a June statement . Noncitizens who vote face deportation or jail time. When people register to vote, they attest under penalty of perjury that they are citizens. The SAVE Act’s documentary proof of citizenship requirement would call for essentially a birth certificate or a passport to register. ""Our research shows that over 9% of adult American citizens don't have those documents readily available,"" Morales-Doyle said. ""So, rather than ‘safeguard American voter eligibility,’ the bill would disenfranchise millions of American citizens. And the impact would be felt disproportionately by citizens of color."" The Bipartisan Policy Center concluded that the SAVE Act, proposed months before the presidential election, needs more time and resources to be applied well. Some cities let certain noncitizens vote in local elections. In May, Gallego voted against allowing noncitizens to vote in Washington, D.C., local elections, a reversal of a position a year ago, the Arizona Republic and Cronkite News found. Former President Donald Trump , some Republican lawmakers and social media influencers have spread false and misleading statements about noncitizen voting. Think tanks, academics , courts and journalists have analyzed claims about noncitizen voting for years and have found only sporadic cases that wouldn’t swing federal elections. Our ruling Lake said, ""Just last week, Ruben Gallego voted to let the millions of people who poured into our country illegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election."" In July, Gallego voted against the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which requires people to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. However, federal law already bans noncitizens from voting in federal elections. We rate this statement False.

"July 15, 2024",Joe Biden,“The idea that there’s political violence or violence in America like this is just unheard of.”,false,"Examples of political violence against U.S. presidents date back to Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Lawmakers, presidents and political candidates have also been targeted. U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., was injured in a 2011 shooting and Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., was injured in a 2017 shooting. The Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol is an example of political violence on a wider scale. Some rioters chanted to ""hang"" Vice President Mike Pence.","As law enforcement investigates an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally, his political opponent President Joe Biden condemned the violence and characterized it as outside the norm. ""The idea that there’s political violence or violence in America like this is just unheard of. It was just not appropriate. And we — everybody — everybody must condemn it. Everybody,"" Biden said in a statement after the July 13 shooting. Law enforcement identified Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, as the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally shooting suspect. Corey Comperatore , a former volunteer fire chief from the area, was killed and two others were critically injured. Neither the White House nor Biden’s campaign provided evidence to back Biden’s statement that this kind of violence is ""unheard of"" in the U.S. The comment ignores that U.S. history shows numerous occasions during which political leaders were targeted by politically-motivated violence, including in recent years. Although it has been decades since an armed person attacked a U.S. president, there have been several assassination attempts throughout modern history. In 2005, a man threw a grenade at President George W. Bush when he was attending a rally in Tbilisi, Georgia, with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan was injured in an assassination attempt, suffering an injured arm, broken rib, punctured lung and serious internal bleeding. Recent attacks on individual members of Congress and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol qualify as political violence. ""The assassination attempt against Trump was in no way unprecedented,"" Rachel Kleinfeld, senior fellow in the democracy, conflict and governance program at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, told PolitiFact in an email. ""In fact, in the current climate of heightened threat and rhetoric, it was almost inevitable that a federal political candidate would be attacked."" Biden’s remarks the next day acknowledged past political violence. ""We must not go down this road in America,"" Biden said. ""We’ve traveled it before throughout our history. Violence has never been the answer, whether it’s with members of Congress in both parties being targeted in the shot, or a violent mob attacking the Capitol on January 6th, or a brutal attack on the spouse of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, or information and intimidation on election officials, or the kidnapping plot against a sitting governor, or an attempted assassination on Donald Trump. There is no place in America for this kind of violence or for any violence ever. Period. No exceptions. We can’t allow this violence to be normalized."" U.S. has long history of political violence News that a former president with Secret Service protection faced a life-threatening, violent attack shocked many Americans. But multiple experts on gun violence and political violence noted that the U.S. has a long history of political violence against presidents, political candidates and Congressional members. Javed Ali, a University of Michigan associate professor of practice who previously worked for the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, said July 14 in an email to PolitiFact that the motivations of the now-deceased suspected shooter remained unclear, but it was ""the latest in a long line of similar events in U.S. history."" Political violence directed at U.S. presidents began with Abraham Lincoln in 1865, followed by James Garfield in 1881, William McKinley in 1901 and John F. Kennedy in 1963, each of whom died after being shot. President Gerald Ford escaped uninjured from two 1975 attempts. Gov. George Wallace survived a shooting in 1972 while running for president. In 1981, Reagan was injured. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., was murdered in June 1968 while campaigning for the presidency. All were shootings or attempted shootings. Two historians documented other examples of candidates or political leaders who faced assassination attempts. The attack on Trump appears to fit a lone shooter ""pattern of politically-motivated violence, which also has been demonstrated against members of Congress in June 2017, when Rep. Steve Scalise was shot and wounded,"" Ali said of the Louisiana Republican. Some experts, including Kleinfeld, also pointed to several examples of political violence directed at groups — particularly communities of color — and prominent political and social justice leaders. ""America has a long history of episodic political violence, from violence against Catholics and immigrants by the Know Nothing party in the early 1800s, to the blood-soaked Kansas-Missouri borderlands in the abolitionist and slave fights of the 1850s, the Civil War, and then the fight against civil rights 1950s to 1960s,"" Kleinfeld said. She added that from 1963 to 1968 alone, assassins killed Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., and both John F. and Robert Kennedy. Members of Congress were shot, other officials have faced threats Threats against members of Congress and federal judges have also increased, Kleinfeld said, and local and state officials have also faced threats. When Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., in 2022 said threats of political violence had increased against election officials, judges and lawmakers, we rated her claim Mostly True . We found that U.S. Capitol Police data showed that threats against members of Congress rose from 902 in 2016 to 9,625 in 2021, a roughly tenfold increase, before declining modestly in 2022. Data released by the Capitol Police in January 2024 showed 7,501 cases in 2022 and 8,008 cases in 2023. Members of Congress from both political parties face a wide range of threats through mail, email, telephone, social media and the internet, Capitol Police said. Earlier this year, in anticipating the campaign season, Capitol Police Assistant Chief of Protective and Intelligence Operations Ashan M. Benedict signaled a focus on the agency’s ""expanding mission"" to keep members of Congress safe. Sam Oliker-Friedland, executive director at the Institute for Responsive Government, a group that works to make government and elections more accessible, said, ""Political violence has been a troubling, consistent issue, less driven by idealogues executing a strategy than troubled people with access to guns who read the news. And from the reporting I'm reading today, this fits that pattern."" Threats against election officials have drawn less attention. In July, a judge sentenced Andrew Nickels, an Indiana man, to 14 months in prison after he left a voicemail threatening the life of Rochester Hills, Michigan, Clerk Tina Barton after the 2020 election. ""Any move toward violence scares me the most for the dedicated public servants who often have many fewer resources than a presidential campaign,"" Oliker-Friedland said. Here are some high-profile political violence incidents over the past 15 years: U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz. : On Jan. 8, 2011, Giffords was shot in the head while meeting with constituents at a ""Congress on your corner"" event in a supermarket parking lot in Casas Adobes, Arizona. Giffords was the target of an assassination attempt and was seriously wounded. According to news reports, Jared Lee Loughner became fixated on Giffords several years before the shooting. Loughner first met Giffords in 2007 at a community event where he asked her a question and was ""unsatisfied with her answer,"" CNN reported. Loughner was sentenced in 2012 to life in prison with no eligibility for parole for the shooting that killed six people and wounded 13 others, including Giffords. U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R- La. : On June 14, 2017, Scalise, then the House majority whip, and four others were wounded when James Hodgkinson shot at them during their baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia. Hodgkinson, who was angry with Trump and posted rants about Republicans online, was killed by police. Authorities reported he was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Paul Pelosi : On Oct. 28, 2022, Pelosi, the husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was attacked in the couple’s San Francisco home by an intruder. David DePape, who intended to kidnap Nancy Pelosi, struck Paul Pelosi in the head with a hammer. DePape was sentenced in May to 30 years in prison following his conviction on assault and attempted kidnapping charges. U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas' son, Daniel Anderl : On July 19, 2020, Anderl was fatally shot by a lawyer posing as a delivery driver at the judge’s New Jersey home, and her husband Mark was injured. Roy Den Hollander , the shooter, shot himself and died.News reports said Hollander described himself as an ""anti-feminist"" lawyer and targeted the judge. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer : In October 2020, law enforcement announced that multiple people were arrested and charged with conspiring to kidnap Whitmer, a Democrat. Multiple people were convicted in state and federal court. U.S. Capitol : More than 1,400 defendants have been charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, as lawmakers inside sought to certify the 2020 election results. Some of the defendants carried weapons . Some rioters threatened the then-vice president, chanting, ""Hang Mike Pence!"" Our ruling Biden said, ""The idea that there’s political violence or violence in America like this is just unheard of."" Although it has been decades since a violent attack targeting a U.S. president, presidents, presidential candidates and political leaders have been targeted by violence throughout U.S. history. Four presidents were assassinated and other presidents survived shootings. In recent years, two House representatives have survived shootings, a House speaker’s husband was attacked, a governor was targeted and the U.S. Capitol, filled with lawmakers, was under siege.

"July 13, 2024",Joe Biden,"""The Trump administration handed out taxpayer dollars to a foreign company. Hundreds of homes and farms were bulldozed, and over $500 million in taxpayer dollars were wasted preparing for Foxconn.""",half-true,"The Trump administration didn’t give taxpayer money to Foxconn — Wisconsin did. Somewhere between 100 and 130 properties were demolished for the project — not ""hundreds."" Yes, more than $500 million was spent, but officials say it also helped lead to a massive new investment by Microsoft Corp.","As the presidential race rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump heats up, the Biden campaign is tying Trump to Wisconsin’s infamous Foxconn deal. ""The Trump administration handed out taxpayer dollars to a foreign company. Hundreds of homes and farms were bulldozed, and over $500 million in taxpayer dollars were wasted preparing for Foxconn,"" the Biden-Harris campaign said in a May 16 news release . The statement was made a little more than a week after Biden was at Gateway Technical College’s Integrated Manufacturing and Engineering Technology Center in Racine County, along with Microsoft President Brad Smith and Gov. Tony Evers to announce a $3.3 billion Microsoft data center. Biden, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported, said the Microsoft Corp. development is a ""comeback story,"" playing out across Wisconsin and the nation. The president said the Microsoft plan stands in contrast to the 2017 efforts of Trump and state Republican officials that brought bring Foxconn to Mount Pleasant. Microsoft is building its data center on land that Foxconn was initially expected to use for a $10 billion LCD manufacturing plant that Trump touted as the ""eighth wonder of the world."" But the investment did not fully happen and neither did the 13,000 jobs Foxconn initially promised. ""Foxconn turned out to be just that,"" Biden said at Gateway . ""A con."" When we asked the Biden campaign to back up the claim, the campaign essentially restated what was originally said. That’s rhetoric, not evidence. Since so much has been written about Foxconn, we started with reports and news accounts. Did Trump hand out ""taxpayer dollars to a foreign company""? The answer to this is a swift ""no."" The original 2017 Foxconn deal called for Wisconsin to provide the company with nearly $3 billion in tax credits if it created 13,000 jobs at a $10 billion state-of-the-art factory for producing liquid crystal displays — flat screens used in televisions and other electronics. However, the company scaled back its plans and under Evers, the incentive package was changed to reflect the smaller scope. In 2021, the tax credits were slashed from $2.85 billion to $80 million. The job benchmark fell from 13,000 statewide to 1,454. And the number for Foxconn’s capital investment went from $10 billion to $672.8 million. In any case, it was state money — not federal money — that was granted to the company. However, then-President Trump was certainly center stage in June 2018, along with then-Gov. Scott Walker, then-U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Foxconn Chair Terry Gou, all wielding gold-colored shovels at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Foxconn Technology Group facility in Mount Pleasant. Were ""hundreds of homes and farms"" bulldozed? Although hundreds of residents were moved out to clear the way for the Foxconn campus, the number of homes and farms has been variously put at between 100 and 132 by different media reports. A Mount Pleasant village spokesperson said officials worked to secure voluntary agreements with owners of about 130 parcels. But other owners said the village threatened eminent domain, claiming their properties were needed for road improvements. According to a 2019 report, the Village of Mount Pleasant by June of that year had paid just over $152 million for 132 properties to clear the way for Foxconn, plus an additional $7.9 million in relocation costs, according to village records obtained by Wisconsin Public Radio and analyzed by Wisconsin Watch . So, the claim’s second part is somewhat off the mark, in that it referred to homes being bulldozed, when it would have been more accurate to say hundreds of residents relocated. When the Biden campaign responded to us, their quote cited ""hundreds of residents,"" not homes. Was ""over $500 million in taxpayer dollars … wasted preparing for Foxconn""? According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , Wisconsin taxpayers were on the hook for at least $583 million preparing for the Foxconn project. If you add in the $257 million from the pockets of American Transmission Company’s Wisconsin electric ratepayers — for new lines and a substation — the total rises to $840 million. But was that money wasted? Mount Pleasant Community Development Director Sam Schultz said the village's investment in the industrial park, when it was created for Foxconn, helped attract Microsoft and made it possible to move quickly after the company began to buy land, according to a May 14 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. ""We benefited from the work that had been done before, the ability to start to acquire large amounts of land and things like a (electrical) substation that exists there already,"" he said. So, saying that ""$500 million in taxpayer dollars were wasted preparing for Foxconn"" is a bit muddy at best. Our ruling Biden claimed ""The Trump administration handed out taxpayer dollars to a foreign company. Hundreds of homes and farms were bulldozed, and over $500 million in taxpayer dollars were wasted preparing for Foxconn."" The claim’s first part is off. The Trump administration didn’t pay — state and local taxpayers did. The second part is an overreach — in terms of houses, the number is between 100 and 130, though there may have been hundreds of residents living in those homes.

"July 12, 2024",Joe Biden,"In 2020, “only nine NATO allies were spending 2%” of their GDP on defense. “This year, 23 will spend at least 2%.”",mostly-true,"In response to instability in the Middle East and Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, NATO leaders agreed in 2014 to aim to commit 2% of their GDP to defense spending by 2024. In 2020, nine NATO members spent at least 2% of their annual gross domestic product on defense, according to NATO data. In 2024, 23 NATO members will spend at least 2% of their GDP to build up their defenses, recent NATO data shows. Experts warned against attributing member nations’ increased defense spending to any one cause or president, though multiple experts linked Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine to the recent uptick in defense spending.","During an address on the 75th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Alliance, President Joe Biden said that NATO allies have increased their defense spending. ""In the year 2020 … the year I was elected president, only nine NATO allies were spending 2% of their defense — GDP on defense,"" Biden said . ""This year, 23 will spend at least 2%. And some will spend more than that."" A White House spokesperson cited NATO’s most recent data, which supports Biden’s claim. In 2024, 23 of 32 NATO members will spend at least 2% of their annual gross domestic product to build up their defenses, June 2024 NATO data shows. That same report said nine allies met the defense spending goal in 2020. Experts said NATO’s data supports Biden’s statement but cautioned against attributing member nations’ increased defense spending to any one cause — or president. The NATO-provided spending figures for 2023 and 2024 were estimates, not finalized numbers, the organization said. We contacted NATO for clarification and received no response before publication. Typically, NATO data older than two years is final, but the previous and current year’s numbers are estimates, said Julie Garey, an associate teaching professor of political science at Northeastern University. Those figures are based on the information those countries provide — not all NATO members have the same fiscal year and not all of the countries have implemented their scheduled spending, experts said. NATO asks members for defense spending information once a year and then publishes updates accordingly, ""but not everything a state counts as ‘defense expenditures’ is included in NATO’s measure of spending,"" Garey said. Why NATO members have a 2% of GDP defense spending goal In 2014 — in response to instability in the Middle East and Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea — NATO leaders agreed to commit 2% of their national gross domestic product to defense spending. That agreement was a nonbinding goal that NATO countries planned to achieve ""within a decade."" The idea is that by spending at least 2% of a country’s GDP on defense, the allies will meet their own defense needs and be able to contribute to collective NATO action, Garey said. But there are no explicit consequences for a country that fails to meet NATO’s 2% of GDP defense spending goal. ""I can never emphasize enough that this is money being spent on each state’s defense — it’s not going directly to the alliance,"" she said. ""This is money that countries are spending on their own soldiers, equipment, and so forth, that they own and control and can use as they deem appropriate."" Countries that haven’t met the target might face pressure from allies to do more, but she said the 2% goal isn’t meant to be a reward or punishment system. Why are more countries meeting the goal in 2024? Experts said there are too many factors to attribute the rising number of countries meeting the 2% benchmark to one cause. The uptick in NATO countries working to increase their defense spending predates both Biden and former President Donald Trump. The key factor driving NATO members’ increased defense spending in 2023 and 2024 is ""a European sense of insecurity after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,"" said Alexandra Chinchilla, assistant professor of international affairs at the Bush School of Government & Public Service at Texas A&M University. Countries such as Latvia have required 2% military spending by law, said Anessa Kimball, a political science professor at Laval University and co-director of the Canadian Defence and Security Network. Other countries have been ""more creative in ‘what counts’ as defense spending,"" Kimball said. For example, Belgium counts railways as part of national defense. Greece counts spending on veterans’ pensions. Some NATO members are likely thinking ""about what a Europe post-NATO might look like"" and what each country might need to prepare if the U.S. left the alliance, Garey said. Trump, who is running for reelection in 2024, has repeatedly threatened to leave NATO. Our ruling Biden said that in 2020, ""only nine NATO allies were spending 2%"" of their GDP on defense, and in 2024 ""23 will spend at least 2%."" June 2024 NATO data supports his claim. NATO’s 2023 and 2024 figures are considered estimates, because not all NATO members have the same fiscal year and not all of the countries have implemented their scheduled spending. The numbers are typically finalized within two years. It's also worth clarifying that countries count ""defense spending"" differently, with some classifying money spent on things such as railways and veterans' pensions. Experts warned against attributing member nations’ increased defense spending to any one cause or president, though multiple experts linked Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine to the recent uptick in defense spending. We rate this claim Mostly True. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.  "
"July 11, 2024",X posts,“Deadlines have passed in … Wisconsin” to replace President Joe Biden on the ballot.,false,"Presidential and vice presidential candidates are placed on the ballot once parties certify their names to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. The deadline for the parties to do so is Sept. 3, which has not passed. That date is after the Democratic National Convention, and Democrats plan to nominate Biden even before the convention.","Speculation — and misinformation — has surrounded what could happen if President Joe Biden decides to exit the presidential race, though he has declared he’ll keep running . That includes multiple posts on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that the deadline to replace Biden on the ballot has passed in Wisconsin. ""I’ve been telling you for days. Deadlines have passed in Nevada and Wisconsin and Republicans are absolutely willing to fight to keep any replacement nominee/ticket off,"" a now-deleted post read. The conservative Heritage Foundation indicated they were eyeing legal challenges in states with deadlines they believed posed obstacles to replacing Biden. Wisconsin, Georgia and Nevada were included. Other posts, including one from July 8, show social media users believe ""Democrats missed the deadline to remove Biden off the ballot in certain states like Wisconsin, Georgia or Nevada."" At PolitiFact Wisconsin, we’re focusing just on the Wisconsin part of the claim. Has the deadline in Wisconsin to replace Biden on the top of the ticket passed? Let’s take a look. Deadline for Democratic Party to place candidates on Wisconsin’s ballot is Sept. 3 When asked about the deadline in Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Elections Commission directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to the commission’s memo about ballot access requirements for presidential and vice presidential candidates. In Wisconsin, the parties that have attained ballot access are currently the Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, Green and Constitution parties. ""The names of candidates for President and Vice President for these parties are placed on the General Election ballot when their names are certified by the state or national chairperson to the Wisconsin Election Commission no later than 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, September 3, 2024, the WEC memo reads. Each certified candidate also must file a Declaration of Candidacy with the commission by that same deadline. So, the key date here is Sept. 3. That’s the deadline for the Democratic party to certify their candidates’ names to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, and when their names will go on the ballot. And a few weeks later, Sept. 19 is the deadline for local clerks to send absentee ballots to voters with requests on file — ballots that will have the parties’ presidential and vice presidential nominees at the top. So, it’s less about replacing Biden — he hasn’t even formally been placed on the November ballot yet in Wisconsin. Democratic National Convention happens in August, about two weeks before Wisconsin deadline There’s another date to keep in mind, and that’s the timing of the Democratic National Convention. The DNC runs from Aug. 19 to 22 — wrapping up a little less than two weeks before Wisconsin’s deadline. And the DNC plans to nominate Biden virtually ahead of the convention because of an earlier deadline in Ohio law. If there were an open convention and Democrats choose another nominee like Vice President Kamala Harris, the convention is still scheduled to end before Wisconsin’s deadline. So, as long as Democrats certify their candidates to the Wisconsin Election Commission by Sept. 3, whoever those names are will be on the ballot. Statute about nominee dying could apply to federal races, but could be litigated Another claim that’s been circulating is that the only way to replace Biden on the ballot is if he dies. We’ve already said the deadline is Sept. 3, but there is a provision in state law that lays out what would happen in that scenario. ""If a vacancy occurs after nomination due to the death of a candidate of a recognized political party for a partisan office, the vacancy may be filled by the chairperson of the committee of the proper political party,"" state law says . That state law would likely apply to federal races like president or vice president, but could be subject to litigation or challenges because it hasn’t been used before. But the law lays out how the party can replace the nominee in the event of the candidate’s death. Our ruling Claims have circulated online that President Joe Biden cannot be replaced on Wisconsin’s ballot because the deadline to do so has passed. ""Replace"" isn’t even the right word here — the November ballot hasn’t been set yet in Wisconsin. Political parties must certify their candidates with the Wisconsin Elections Commission by Sept. 3. And that date is after the Democratic National Convention will conclude, and the party currently plans to nominate Biden even before the convention starts. We rate claims that the Wisconsin deadline has passed False. "

"July 2, 2024",Tom Cotton,"“The weapons that Ukraine used in the early days of this war to fend off the Russian invasion are the weapons that Donald Trump sent, that Barack Obama and Joe Biden had refused to send.”",half-true,"The Obama administration in 2014 rejected Ukraine’s request for lethal aid. The Trump administration in 2018 approved a plan to sell Javelin missiles to Ukraine. The Biden administration has approved billions of dollars in assistance to Ukraine, including Javelins.","Former President Donald Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ""the greatest salesman"" who repeatedly gets billions of dollars from the United States. ""It never ends,"" Trump said at a June 15 campaign rally in Michigan. On June 16 on CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" host Jake Tapper asked Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., about Trump’s recent comments on Ukraine. Cotton praised Trump’s position on Ukraine and criticized Democrats. ""The weapons that Ukraine used in the early days of this war to fend off the Russian invasion are the weapons that Donald Trump sent, that Barack Obama and Joe Biden had refused to send,"" Cotton said. Cotton spokesperson Patrick McCann told PolitiFact that Cotton was referring to Javelins, antiarmor missiles provided by the Trump administration. In 2014, Obama rejected a request by Ukraine for those weapons. Biden was Obama’s vice president. Trump reversed Obama’s policy; in 2018, the Trump administration approved a plan to sell Ukraine Javelin missiles for $47 million . ""As you can see, it is clear that this form of lethal aid was both important and provided by the Trump administration and not the Obama-Biden one,"" McCann said. However, Cotton’s comments don’t tell the full story about military aid to Ukraine under Obama, Trump and Biden. Cotton’s ""comment is correct in the sense that Obama never approved transfer of lethal weaponry but Trump did,"" said Michael O’Hanlon, senior fellow in the foreign policy program of the Brookings Institution, a think tank. ""I would not implicate Biden heavily in the policy of the Obama years; he was just one voice at the table then. He did far more than his former boss ever did for Ukraine, and far more (from February 2022 onward) than Trump ever did, either."" As the president during Russia’s invasion, Biden has signed off on Ukrainian aid that included Javelins. Obama rejected Ukraine’s request for lethal aid in 2014, Trump provided it Experts on Ukraine military assistance said that the Obama administration rejected Ukraine’s 2014 request for lethal aid . The decision came as Russian forces invaded the eastern territory of Crimea in 2014 and pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine . U.S. officials were concerned that providing Javelins to Ukraine would escalate their conflict with Russia. ""In this sense, Cotton’s claim has some truth to it,"" said Brendan Green, associate professor at the University of Cincinnati's School of Public and International Affairs. However, Obama’s White House approved other aid . In total, from 2014 to 2016, the United States committed more than $600 million in security assistance to Ukraine. Under Obama, the federal government started the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which sent other kinds of U.S. military equipment to the country. From federal fiscal years 2016 to 2019, which overlap with Obama and Trump, Congress appropriated $850 million . Trump also withheld aid when trying to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. During a July 2019 phone call , Zelenskyy told Trump he was almost ready to buy more Javelins from the U.S. Trump replied by asking for ""a favor,"" which was to collect dirt on Biden, a potential 2020 presidential race opponent at the time. In January 2020, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office concluded that Trump abused his power by telling Zelenskyy the U.S. would provide Ukraine with security assistance and he would grant Zelenskyy a White House meeting only if Zelenskyy announced investigations into Trump’s political rivals. The House impeached Trump for this matter in 2019; the Senate acquitted him in 2020. Biden administration has supported billions in aid for Ukraine Cotton said that Trump provided ""the weapons that Ukraine used in the early days of this war."" Russia’s invasion started in February 2022 when Biden was president. During the Biden administration, the U.S. has provided extensive military aid to Ukraine, including weapons. Some of that military aid was sent before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and some followed the invasion. Every new president inherits the spending that was approved under the previous president. In Biden’s case, when he took office in January 2021, he was working with the last spending approved by Trump; this ran through September 2021. But the Biden administration went beyond this Trump-enacted spending and used the Presidential Drawdown Authority to send aid to Ukraine multiple times. That authority allows the president to provide military assistance during crisis situations. The State Department secretary exercised authority delegated by the president to direct 44 ""drawdowns"" since August 2021, according to a June statement from the department . In March 2021, the Defense Department announced a $125 million package for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative that included equipment. On Sept. 1, 2021 the federal government announced a new $60 million security assistance package . A Congressional Research Service report said that in federal fiscal year 2021, State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development allocations to Ukraine totaled about $464 million, including $115 million in the Foreign Military Financing program. In January 2022, Biden authorized the State Department to allow transfer of U.S.-provided equipment already in the hands of allies, Defense One reported based on information it received from the National Security Council. The State Department in January 2022 also cleared three NATO allies to rush antiarmor missiles and other U.S.-made weapons to Ukraine, Politico reported . The Biden administration also began shipping $200 million worth of antiarmor missiles, ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine, Politico wrote. In February 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Biden authorized $350 million of military assistance from Defense Department inventories, including antiarmor, small arms, munitions and body armor. It was the third time Biden expedited emergency security assistance for Ukraine’s defense in the months leading up to the invasion using the Presidential Drawdown Authority, the Defense Department said. We wrote after the war’s first year that Congress had approved four separate measures that allocated money to benefit Ukraine, totaling $113 billion. About $50 billion was for direct military aid. Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, said that the aid to Ukraine since 2022 ""has included all of the really significant lethal weapon systems sent by the U.S., including artillery, anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and rocket systems. And much of that aid was opposed by Republicans in Congress and by former President Trump."" Ultimately, both the Trump and Biden administrations sent Ukraine ""weapon systems that helped during the 2022 invasion,"" Janda said. Steven Pifer, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 1998 to 2000, agreed that Cotton has a point that the Obama administration did not provide the Javelin antiarmor missiles to Ukraine and that the Trump administration provided a limited number of Javelin missiles. ""However, he is incorrect as regards the Biden administration,"" Pifer said, noting Biden’s provision of sophisticated weapons including rocket systems, fighting vehicles and missiles. ""Since the war, Biden has sent the Ukrainians just about everything and the kitchen sink,"" Green said. Our ruling Cotton said, ""The weapons that Ukraine used in the early days of this war to fend off the Russian invasion are the weapons that Donald Trump sent, that Barack Obama and Joe Biden had refused to send."" The Obama administration in 2014, while Biden was vice president, did reject Ukraine’s request for lethal Javelin missiles, although it supplied other aid. Trump reversed that policy and approved a plan to sell Javelins. Cotton stretches this claim by tying Obama’s policy to Biden, who as president has built on Trump’s assistance and more. Biden’s administration shipped $200 million worth of antiarmor missiles, ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine before Russia’s invasion. The Biden administration also authorized $350 million of military assistance from Defense Department inventories, including antiarmor, small arms, munitions and body armor immediately after the invasion.

PolitiFact had ruled that original Biden administration claim as True. The U.S. Census Bureau and the Federal Reserve Board data reported record levels of Black business ownership in 2021 and 2022.,"As President Joe Biden ramps up efforts to win over Wisconsin voters, one of Milwaukee’s leading Democratic officials lauded the gains Black Americans made under the Biden administration. On May 16, during an event for Vice President Kamala Harris, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley claimed: ""Under (the Biden) administration we have witnessed the fastest growth of black-owned small businesses in more than 30 years."" Let’s dig into the numbers. Crowley quoting the White House? What Crowley said might have sounded very familiar. Why? In early 2023, Biden spoke of the record numbers of new Black entrepreneurs during campaign speeches Jan. 27 in South Carolina and Feb. 4 in Las Vegas . The White House even released a factsheet discussing similar claims Feb. 6. Here’s what the fact sheet laid out: Since the President entered office, a record 16 million new business applications have been filed, and the share of Black households owning a business has more than doubled. Building on this momentum, the Biden-Harris Administration has: Achieved the fastest creation rate of Black-owned businesses in more than 30 years — and more than doubled the share of Black business owners from 2019 to 2022. PolitiFact National did an earlier fact-check on the Biden administration’s statements on Black entrepreneurs from the fact sheet and rated it True. Census Bureau and the Federal Reserve Board datasets found record levels of Black business ownership in 2021 and 2022. Independent analyses say that some of Biden’s policies likely played a role. PolitiFact cited a Brookings Institution analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Business Survey that showed the number of Black-owned businesses with more than one employee has increased every year since 2017. In the same fact-check, PolitiFact cited the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances from 2022. It reported that 11% of Black households held equity in a business. When PolitiFact contacted the Biden administration for comment for its fact-check, the White House ""shared independent analyses suggesting that some Biden policies helped spur these increases."" The analyses in question focused on changes the Biden administration made to a pandemic-era initiative, the Paycheck Protection Program, which lent money to small businesses that needed it. Our ruling On May 16, Crowley said: ""Under (the Biden) administration we have witnessed the fastest growth of black-owned small businesses in more than 30 years."" Crowley had been referring to a statement the White House made earlier this year, which PolitiFact had fact-checked and found was supported by Census Bureau and the Federal Reserve Board data and independent analysis.

He added, ""Many Republicans like to vote on Election Day"" and, ""if you can’t make it, you need to make a plan, register and vote any way possible."" He posted a similar statement on Truth Social. Trump promoted the website and the various voting options at a June rally in Phoenix. ""Vote early, vote absentee, vote mail-in, vote in person. I don’t care how they vote, just get out and vote,"" Trump said at a June rally in Philadelphia . Republican strategists have shifted their stance on voting by mail Republicans in many states have used voting by mail for years to win elections. After Trump lost in 2020, Republican strategists renewed efforts to promote voting by mail. Republican groups in Pennsylvania promoted voting by mail this year and Trump’s son Donald Jr. recorded a message: ""if you’re working a double shift or family responsibilities prevent you from voting on Election Day Joe Biden wins. Pennsylvania, I need you to join the mail-in voting list today. Visit skipthelinepa.vote."" CBS News reported that one reason Trump now promotes voting by mail is that advisers showed him data showing they could broaden their outreach to swing voters in battlegrounds if their base was comfortable with early voting. Our ruling A liberal political action committee’s ad said Trump is ""against mail in voting."" The ad uses video clips of statements Trump made against voting by mail in 2020 and February. Trump has spoken negatively about voting by mail at times in 2024 and said his goal is to create ""one-day voting."" But Trump has also repeatedly told Republicans to simply vote — and has said they can choose to cast ballots by mail. We rate this statement Half True. "
"June 21, 2024",Donald Trump,Says he “saved Kenosha” and the “governor wouldn’t move” on sending the National Guard.,pants-fire,"Protests occurred in a limited area, as we noted in a 2020 fact-check, compared with the entire scope of the city. Factors besides the National Guard presence decreased violence, including a drop in the number of armed people and calls for peace. State-level National Guard efforts began before the Trump administration got involved.","In the middle of talking about crime and immigration in his June 18 rally in Racine, Wisconsin, former President Donald Trump turned his attention to Kenosha. Kenosha — about 11 miles south of where Trump held his rally — was rocked by civil unrest in 2020 after a police officer shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, seven times. The officer was not criminally charged . While there was looting, firebombing and violence during some nights of the protests, others were peaceful. ""I saved Kenosha, do you know that?"" Trump told the crowd. ""I saved it. Kenosha was about ready to go down the tubes."" ""The governor wouldn’t move, he just wouldn’t move, and I moved,"" he said. ""You know, I’m not supposed to, it’s supposed to be the governor is supposed to do it. The mayor and the governor."" Trump has made similar claims before: that Kenosha would have been destroyed without him and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers was too late to send help. In 2020, PolitiFact Wisconsin rated those claims Pants on Fire. There were three assumptions, which were also at play in Trump’s latest claims, that we investigated: Kenosha was on a trajectory for destruction. No other changes happened that would have improved the situation in Kenosha. Trump alone is responsible for activating the National Guard. In our 2020 fact check, we found each to be wrong. Let’s go through those again. Protests occurred in a limited area compared to entire city There’s a big difference between protests damaging a limited area and destroying or altering a large portion of a city of 100,000 people, we noted in that fact-check. The protests, even at the peak of the unrest Aug. 25, 2020, were largely concentrated in the one-acre Civic Park and a nearby area a few blocks wide, though people spilled into nearby neighborhoods after the largest groups were dispersed. That drastically exaggerates the scope of the situation in Kenosha, a city of 28.4 square miles, even at its worst. That goes against Trump’s new statement of the city being ""about ready to go down the tubes."" Other factors beside National Guard presence reduced violence, including calls for peace In 2020, Trump’s attempt to claim credit assumed the National Guard presence was the only factor in the lack of violence after Kyle Rittenhouse shot three people and killed two. Rittenhouse was later found not guilty on five counts, including intentional, reckless and attempted homicide. There were other reasons why violence slowed down after that, including a change in who was in the crowd. A group described by Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth as ""a militia"" and ""vigilante group"" had been patrolling the streets of Kenosha and even standing watch on roofs with long guns the first couple of nights after the Blake shooting. In the hours before the shootings, the ""Kenosha Guard"" issued a call on Facebook for ""patriots willing to take up arms and defend out (sic) City tonight from the evil thugs."" That page was removed by Facebook after the Rittenhouse shooting. And people wearing military gear and openly carrying weapons decreased drastically after the night of chaos that included the shooting, according to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporters who were on the ground in Kenosha. Nevertheless, citizens with handguns were observed as late as the weekend. During the height of the protests, the vigilante groups and Black Lives Matter protesters were regularly clashing with one another, by hurling insults or worse. Removing half of that equation — for whatever reason that occurred — changed the situation dramatically. Besides a drop in armed people, there were also calls for peace, including from Blake’s family, at marches and rallies, and — to varying degrees — from Evers and local officials. Evers also declared a state of emergency, and local officials took steps to better control the area, such as closing off freeway access. That was in addition to increasing the number of troops, which also happened. Trump did not send the National Guard, state efforts began before Trump talked to Wisconsin officials That brings us to the final part of the claim, and something Trump noted again at his rally in Racine: that he was responsible for sending in the National Guard, and Evers didn’t act. The White House described itself as authorizing 2,000 National Guard troops to go to Kenosha. But Maj. Gen. Paul Knapp, who then commanded the Wisconsin National Guard, said that’s not really how that system operates. He described it this way when asked what role the White House played in the Kenosha response. ""What I want to re-emphasize is the process is actually a governor-to-governor compact,"" Knapp said. ""Through the (Emergency Management Assistance Compact) process we had already started talking to other states (when the White House got involved), it’s one of the things we do right away during something like this."" Each state has its own National Guard — as provided for in the Constitution — and the guard has a role at both the state and federal level, according to its website. Governors can call the National Guard into action during local or statewide emergencies. On Aug. 24, 2020, Evers activated the Guard, less than 24 hours after Blake was shot. The Trump administration talked to Evers on Aug. 25, 2020. The president can also activate the guard for federal missions. Examples of federal missions given on the website included deployments to Kosovo or the anti-terrorism efforts in the Middle East. After the Rittenhouse shooting, Evers increased National Guard troop numbers from 250 to 500. Evers also accepted federal troops from the Trump administration, after initially turning down federal help. We noted that in a related fact-check in 2021 . Evers’ administration said the White House was offering help from the Department of Homeland Security, not the National Guard. Evers had declined because more Guard members had already been sent. Our ruling At a rally in Racine, Trump made similar claims to ones he said almost four years ago: that he ""saved Kenosha"" and the ""governor wouldn’t move"" on sending the National Guard. Other factors besides the National Guard’s presence calmed the situation in Kenosha, including calls for peace and a reduction in the number of armed people. Trump also said Kenosha was ""about ready go down the tubes,"" though protests were largely contained to one acre of the larger city — exaggerating the scope of the situation. Finally, Trump was not responsible for sending in the National Guard. State-level efforts began before his administration got involved. His administration did send in federal troops, but Evers had activated the National Guard before that. Based on those findings in our previous fact-checks, we again rate Trump’s claims Pants on Fire.

""Trump can’t be on the Texas ballot because of our state constitution,"" the post said. It appeared about one week after a Manhattan jury convicted Trump of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The post continued: ""The United States Constitution does not prohibit felons from holding elected federal office. However, various federal statutes provide that a conviction may result in loss of or ineligibility for office. Texas law prohibits any person convicted of a felony from being a candidate for public office or holding any public office position. A full pardon restores eligibility to run for office."" The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. The post wrongly states that Texas’ constitution would knock Trump off the ballot. ""The qualifications of federal office are outlined by the U.S. Constitution, not the Texas Constitution,"" Alicia Phillips Pierce, a spokesperson for Texas’ secretary of state, told PolitiFact in an email. The Texas secretary of state’s website lists the qualifications for the presidency and does not mention criminal history. That’s because it wouldn’t disqualify a candidate from running for the presidency. The U.S. Constitution upholds the principle that voters decide who should represent them, and its qualifications are limited to natural-born citizenship, age (35 by Inauguration Day) and residency in the United States (14 years). Texas election code prohibits anyone who is ""finally convicted of a felony"" from running for office in the state, but that doesn’t cover the U.S. presidency, which is a federal office, said Mimi Marziani, an adjunct professor at University of Texas at Austin law school who has taught constitutional law. ""It does mean that if Trump were finally convicted — after his appeals, etc. — that he would be ineligible to run for, say, Texas Governor,"" said Marziani, a lawyer in private practice and former president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, a nonprofit group advocating for voting rights. Texas election code states that a political party is entitled to have the names of its nominees for president and vice president on the ballot as long as those nominees meet the qualifications ""prescribed by federal law."" Andy Taylor, an election lawyer in Texas who has represented many Texas Republicans, agreed that the claim that Trump’s felony conviction bars him from the ballot is wrong. ""Trump can and will be on the ballot in Texas,"" Taylor said. People convicted of felonies have run for president in the past. Lyndon LaRouche was convicted in 1988 of tax and mail fraud conspiracy and ran for president multiple times from 1976 to 2004. Eugene Debs was convicted of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 for an anti-war speech, then ran for president under the Socialist Party banner from a federal prison in Alabama in 1920. Trump faces sentencing July 11. It is unknown whether he will receive jail time. Our ruling A Threads post said, ""Trump can’t be on the Texas ballot because of our state constitution."" The U.S. Constitution does not state that felony convictions bar someone from running for president, and the federal framework supersedes any state rules on whether someone can run for president.

"• June 12,",Donald Trump,"“Congo, Africa, just released a lot of people, a lot of people from their prisons and jails and brought them into the United States of America.”",pants-fire,"U.S. border officials have encountered migrants from the Democratic Republic of Congo more than 2,000 times during the Biden administration. But experts on prisons or Congo said that they had no evidence to back up Trump’s statement about people coming from jails and prisons.","A persistent theme of former President Donald Trump’s false immigration rhetoric is that immigrants are pouring across the border after leaving mental institutions, jails or prisons. He has made such claims broadly about immigrants , and specifically about people from Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo . ""The Congo has just released a lot of people from jail,"" Trump said May 31 after his New York conviction for falsifying business records. ""Congo, Africa, just released a lot of people, a lot of people from their prisons and jails and brought them into the United States of America."" We found no evidence that Congo’s government releases prisoners and sends them to the United States. We previously also could not corroborate the claim about masses of Venezuelan prisoners coming to the U.S. Here we’ll focus on Trump’s claims about people from Congo, something he’s been repeating at least since January. Experts had no evidence to back up Trump's statement We asked the Trump campaign if he was referring to people who crossed the border legally or illegally and for his evidence that Congolese were coming from jails and prisons to the U.S. In her response, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed to overall data about illegal immigration including ""gotaways"" — a term immigration officials use for people who evade U.S. Border Patrol detection. ""Border Patrol continues to apprehend special interest aliens and terror suspects at the border from countries like the Congo, China, and Afghanistan,"" she said. We’ve found that Customs and Border Protection does not publicly release data on ""special interest aliens."" We’ve also reported that U.S. immigration officials have encountered rising numbers of people on the terrorist watchlist. But not everyone on the list is a terrorist, and not everyone encountered is allowed to enter the country. Leavitt also cited a PBS NewsHour story that said human traffickers are ""smuggling people from as far away as Congo, India and China."" None of these sources said that Congolese were being released from jail or prison and sent to the U.S. The Democratic Republic of Congo is the ""big Congo,"" a former Belgian colony that has Kinshasa as its capital, said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, a research and advocacy group. The Republic of the Congo is the ""little Congo,"" a former French colony that has Brazzaville as its capital. They are adjacent to each other and separated by the Congo River. The majority of the U.S. Border Patrol encounters are with people from the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2022, increased violence exacerbated insecurity in the Democratic Republic of Congo, internally displacing hundreds of thousands of people, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency . The agency says more than 6.2 million people are displaced and 1 million have sought asylum, mostly within Africa. U.S. border officials stopped people from both the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of the Congo more than 2,800 times during the Trump administration and have done so more than 3,700 times during Biden’s administration. About 12,600 refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo arrived in the U.S. from fiscal years 2021 to 2022 (latest figures available). Fiscal year 2021, which ran from Oct. 1, 2020, to Sept. 30, 2021, includes a few months of the Trump administration. The numbers of refugees from the Republic of Congo were in the single digits annually for Trump and Biden. Refugees arrive in the U.S. legally and must pass security background checks before being let into the country. Experts on prisons or the Congo said that they had no evidence to back up Trump’s statement about people coming to the U.S. from Congo’s jails and prisons. ""No one in the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) is aware of this fact,"" said Abdoulaye Diarra, Amnesty International’s Central Africa researcher. Mudge said, ""We have looked into this on the DRC side and have seen no evidence of this."" Helen Fair, a World Prison Brief researcher, also said she could not substantiate Trump’s statement. ""I do a daily news search to keep an eye on what’s going on in prisons around the world, and I haven’t seen any news reports of the mass release of people from prisons in Congo, and certainly not that they’ve then been sent to prisons in the US,"" Fair told PolitiFact. Joshua Z. Walker, programs director at the Congo Research Group at New York University, said that beginning in late March, approximately 300 prisoners from the main prison in Kinshasa were released. But Walker said he knew of no evidence that the released prisoners went to the U.S. The Congolese government is facing an insurgency by a Rwanda-backed armed group that is occupying much of the government's attention and resources. ""There is no chance that it would be interested in pursuing the costly, complicated, and risky endeavor of sending former prisoners to illegally enter the U.S,"" Walker said. Our ruling Trump said ""Congo, Africa, just released a lot of people, a lot of people from their prisons and jails and brought them into the United States of America."" Trump’s comments leave the impression that some official entity in Congo is releasing prisoners and bringing them to the U.S. We found no evidence to back that up. The Trump campaign pointed to overall data on illegal immigration during Biden’s administration and one news article that said human traffickers brought people from multiple countries including Congo. There are some immigrants from the Democratic Republic of Congo in the U.S., but that doesn’t mean they were part of a government-run effort to send criminals to the U.S. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

Experts said despite the data’s limitations, there is no evidence to support Trump’s repeated statements that ""millions"" of immigrants in the country illegally came from jails, prisons or mental institutions.","Former President Donald Trump, who has promised to carry out the ""largest domestic deportation operation"" in U.S. history if reelected, says an enormous number of immigrants entering the country illegally are people with mental illnesses or criminal records. President Joe Biden ""is letting millions of people from jails, from prisons, from insane asylums, from mental institutions, drug dealers pour in,"" Trump told reporters May 29 in Manhattan during his falsified business records trial. ""Venezuela, if you look at their crime statistics, they’ve gone down 72% in crime because they’re releasing all their criminals into our country because of this horrible president that we have."" We fact-checked a similar statement by Trump about Venezuela and rated it False . Here, we will examine Trump’s statement that ""millions"" of immigrants are pouring in from jails and mental institutions — a frequent Trump talking point that reporters have examined and debunked before . Some migrants have criminal records, but we found no evidence that they add up to millions. Federal data shows some immigrants have criminal records U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2024, immigration officials arrested about 103,700 noncitizens with criminal convictions whether in the U.S. or abroad, so long as the conviction was for conduct deemed criminal by the U.S. Some key points about this number: Includes people stopped at and between ports of entry. Not everyone stopped was let in. The term ""noncitizens"" includes people who may have legal immigration status in the U.S., but are not U.S. citizens. Fiscal year 2021 includes about four months of Trump’s administration; the data for fiscal year 2024 is incomplete. (The federal fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.) The data reflects the numbers the federal government knows about, but it’s inexhaustive. ""A pro-Trump responder would say (correctly) that countries like Venezuela or Cuba don’t share their criminal databases with the US, and other countries' justice systems are in general disarray anyway (Haiti, Honduras etc.),"" border security expert Adam Isacson wrote in an email to PolitiFact. But Trump’s ""millions"" statement is ""laughable,"" said Isacson, defense oversight director at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy organization. Including repeat crossers, there’ve been around 8 million encounters at the border since Biden took office, Isacson said. For reference, encounters data represents events, not people. For example, if one person tries to cross the border three times and is stopped each time, that would be counted as three encounters. This data also doesn’t tell us how many people stayed in the U.S. ""‘Millions’ would mean one in eight was someone released from a jail or a mental institution, a claim too ridiculous to dignify,"" Isacson said. It also ""strains belief,"" he said, that someone with serious mental illness could navigate the route to the U.S. after release from an institution. Mike LaSusa, deputy content director for InSight Crime, a think tank focused on crime and security in the Americas, said that because the U.S. government doesn’t stop everyone who crosses, it’s impossible to know exactly how many criminals may have entered. However, LaSusa said, the claim of ‘millions’ coming from prisons seemed mathematically and logically unlikely. ""The trend in recent years has generally been toward locking more people up, not letting them out so they can emigrate,"" he said. The federal government’s data showed Border Patrol apprehended 2,033 gang members nationwide from fiscal years 2021 to 2024 . The El Paso Times reported that the Tren de Aragua gang, which originated in Venezuelan prisons, ""has been detected in the El Paso-Juárez borderlands among the continuing arrival of thousands of migrants seeking political asylum."" The article did not say how many were ""detected."" CBP data shows that border officials have apprehended 47 Tren de Aragua gang members during Biden’s presidency. Under Biden, the U.S. has expelled, removed or returned people out of the U.S. around 3.8 million times, according to PolitiFact’s March analysis of Department of Homeland Security data . In September 2021, DHS released a memo instructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prioritize removing people who have crossed the border in recent years or who threaten public safety. Courts halted those guidelines in 2021, but they were reinstated in 2023 after a Supreme Court decision. Biden on June 4 announced a new order to limit the number of migrants seeking asylum at the border. Why it’s questionable that millions of immigrants came from ""insane asylums"" or mental institutions Pierluigi Mancini , an Atlanta-based expert on immigrant behavioral health, also told PolitiFact that Trump’s statement about emptying facilities of people with mental illness who are coming to the U.S. ""does not make sense because those numbers are not there."" Many people in Latin American countries face barriers to getting mental health treatment, Mancini said, and ""if there are mentally ill persons flooding the United States, they are not coming from psychiatric hospitals."" Often, people pay smugglers thousands of dollars to help them get into the U.S. Also, immigrants usually must wait in Guatemala or Mexico before they try to cross into the U.S. And then they need the physical fortitude to make the journey ""something that someone with a serious mental illness may be unable to,"" Mancini said. Trump campaign has pointed to news articles that don’t support his statement We asked the Trump campaign for its evidence and received no reply. But in 2023, the campaign pointed CNN to an article a Border Patrol veteran wrote for Breitbart , a conservative news website. The article was based on information from an unnamed source at Customs and Border Protection and a Homeland Security intelligence report (we did not see the report and PolitiFact does not rely on anonymous information). The article said the report found the Venezuelan government was freeing inmates, including those convicted of rape and murder, and that they were seen traveling to the border, but included no specific numbers. The Trump campaign also cited to CNN a 1983 Washington Post article about criminals who came from Cuba via the Mariel boatlift. The article said that Cuba’s then-leader Fidel Castro put inmates and people with mental illness on the boats and that 22,000 arrivals admitted that they were convicts. But reporters who were based in South Florida then later said that the claims were inflated. Academics and U.S. federal government researchers agreed . And Trump’s statement wasn’t about historical migration. Our ruling Trump said Biden ""is letting millions of people from jails, from prisons, from insane asylums, from mental institutions, drug dealers pour in."" The Trump campaign provided no evidence to support this claim to PolitiFact, and news articles the campaign has previously cited don’t prove that millions of such immigrants are coming into the U.S. Are there some immigrants with criminal records who try getting into the U.S.? Yes. But Trump’s statement about ""millions"" is a gross exaggeration. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

"June 5, 2024",Joe Biden,"“Due to the arrangements that I've reached with (Mexico) President Obrador, the number of migrants coming … to our shared border unlawfully in recent months has dropped dramatically.”",mostly-true,U.S. Border Patrol data shows migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped from December to April. Immigration experts said it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for any change in border crossings. But they acknowledged that Mexico has been intercepting a much higher number of migrants in recent months because of agreements with the U.S. government.,"President Joe Biden issued a new directive June 4 to limit the number of migrants seeking asylum at the southern U.S. border. Biden’s proclamation comes weeks before he and former President Donald Trump face off in their first 2024 presidential debate and as they battle over their records on immigration policies. The Biden administration’s directive suspends and limits the entry of certain noncitizens into the U.S. across the southern border when the Homeland Security secretary determines that there has been an average of 2,500 encounters or more at the border over seven consecutive days. To halt the suspension, the numbers would have to drop to fewer than 1,500 encounters on average seven days in a row. Encounters data represents events, not people. For example, if one person tries to cross the border three times and is stopped each time, that would be counted as three encounters. This data also doesn’t tell us how many people stayed in the U.S. The order takes effect immediately because current daily encounters exceed 2,500, according to the administration . In a speech June 4 at the White House, Biden said the numbers of encounters are dropping already. ""The facts are clear, due to the arrangements that I've reached with (Mexican) President (Andrés Manuel López) Obrador, the number of migrants coming … to our shared border unlawfully in recent months has dropped dramatically,"" Biden said. ""While these steps are important, they're not enough to truly secure the border."" We found that the encounter numbers have dropped in recent months amid increased interceptions by Mexico. But immigration experts told PolitiFact it's difficult to pinpoint one reason for any change in migration numbers. The White House pointed to the latest publicly available data from the U.S. Border Patrol showing immigration officials encountered people illegally crossing the border about 128,900 times in April compared with about 250,000 in December. That’s a 48.4% decrease. The numbers of encounters at ports of entry have also dropped During a May 13 news conference , López Obrador said the number of migrants reaching the southern U.S. border had dropped by about 50%. Mexico's crackdown on migrant crossings David Bier, immigration studies director at the libertarian Cato institute, said Biden is correct to attribute border encounter declines to actions by Mexico, but offered a caveat. ""Mexico is making unprecedented arrests,"" Bier said. ""I believe that it is unsustainable because, although Mexico is arresting them and sending them to southern Mexico, they are not deporting them to their home countries. This means that it is very likely they will ultimately find their way to the United States because they are still in Mexico, and there's not much for them to do there except keep trying to get to the U.S."" U.S. officials said Mexico’s willingness to stop migrants from entering the U.S. is largely because of increased dialogue between the two countries. Biden and López Obrador have spoken multiple times since late 2023 and have released joint statements over the last several months about joint efforts to curb immigration, fentanyl and firearms trafficking. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken also went to Mexico in December to meet with their Mexican counterparts. ""As we made clear in Mexico City today, we are committed to partnering with Mexico to address our shared challenges, including managing unprecedented irregular migration in the region, reopening key ports of entry, and combating illicit fentanyl and other synthetic drugs,"" Blinken wrote Dec. 27 on X . A White House summary of a conversation in April between Biden and López Obrador said the two politicians ordered their national security teams to apply measures that would ""significantly reduce irregular border crossings"" and to address the root causes of the migration. U.S. immigration experts said it’s difficult to isolate single causes for any change in the number of arrivals at the border, but agreed that Mexico vastly increased its enforcement efforts after discussions between the two nations. However, ""there is no reason to think that this drop will be long-lasting, especially considering the number of migrants who are likely stranded in Mexico right now,"" said Adam Isacson, defense oversight director at Washington Office on Latin America, a group advocating for human rights in the Americas. ""No crackdown in the last 10 years has had a lasting impact, not even Title 42,"" he said. Title 42 is a public health policy invoked during the COVID-19 pandemic to decrease the number of migrants entering the U.S. Whether the declines continue is uncertain, because migrants and migrant smugglers ""have proven highly adaptable to changes in policy, process, operations and even infrastructure,"" said Theresa Cardinal Brown, senior adviser for immigration and border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank. ""We have not seen sustained decreases in arrivals after policy changes in the past."" The data also doesn’t reflect the changing demographics and nationalities of people arriving, nor the factors sending them to the border. Continued fluctuation in numbers of arrivals is expected if there is no consistent immigration policy to address the ongoing migration crisis, Brown said. Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that supports low levels of immigration, said it’s hard to say how much Mexico’s actions have contributed to the decline, but that the numbers are still high. ""It is possible their actions matter, but even if they do, we have no idea if Mexico will continue to take action nor do we know if the smugglers and migrants will simply adapt and the modest decline will disappear."" Our ruling Biden said, ""Due to the arrangements that I've reached with President Obrador, the number of migrants coming … to our shared border unlawfully in recent months has dropped dramatically."" U.S. Border Patrol data shows immigrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped in recent months. Immigration experts said it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for any change in border crossings, but acknowledged that the decrease comes amid more cooperation between the two countries.

Trump had a 2-point lead among both registered and likely voters in Wisconsin, the latest Marquette University Law School Poll found in April. Other polls released in May showed Biden with a lead in Wisconsin. A New York Times/Siena College poll found Biden led in Wisconsin, but not five other battleground states.

First, we will look back at polls during Johnson’s three runs for U.S. Senate to see where they fell. Then, we’ll add some context about what to keep in mind when looking at early polls. Polling did show Johnson trailed in earlier months of the election cycle When we asked for backup, Johnson spokesperson Kiersten Pels shared a few poll examples, including a poll in which Johnson’s lead was much higher than his final margin and some in which his opponents were polling quite a bit above him, even in the weeks before the election. ""Simply put, the polls were significantly wrong, especially in the last two races. He instinctively knew those races would be close, he ignored the polls, and was proven correct,"" she said. ""The elections were close."" Since some polls are better than others, let’s look at averages of multiple polls collected by RealClearPolling.com during Johnson’s three U.S. Senate runs – in 2010, 2016 and 2022. 2010 election In 2010, Johnson ran against Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold. According to RealClearPolling’s averages , Feingold was about 2 percentage points ahead of Johnson in July and August. Then Feingold was up about 1 point through mid-September. After the primary, Johnson pulled ahead of Feingold, polling 6 to 10 percentage points above Feingold for the rest of the race. Johnson won that election with 52%, compared with Feingold’s 47%. 2016 election This election was a rematch of Johnson and Feingold. By that point, Johnson would have had more recognition as an incumbent. S,o if that was a factor in early polls in 2010, it was less so in 2016. Feingold had a lead over Johnson the entire race, according to RealClearPolling’s averages . Johnson trailed by more than 12 points between April and August of 2015 — which were very early polls. Feingold was still leading by upwards of 10 points for most of the campaign, until it narrowed in the last month or so. Johnson pulled off an upset that year, winning with about 50%, compared to Feingold’s 47%. 2022 election Those averages are a little easier to parse. Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes had a 4-to-5 point lead until mid-September. Around the time of the primary, their leads switched. Johnson stayed about three points ahead of Barnes for the rest of the campaign. Johnson won by just a percentage point: 50.5% to Barnes’ 49.5%. To summarize: Polling conducted in the early months of the election cycles did show Johnson trailing, though he won all three elections. That’s most obvious in 2016, when Feingold led essentially the entire time. But does that mean the early polls are ""wildly incorrect,"" as Johnson said? It’s a little more complicated than that. Polls are a snapshot in time rather than a predictor, Johnson’s 2016 race is a good example PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out to Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette University Law School Poll, for context. ""It’s an old line, but polls are a snapshot in time,"" Franklin said. ""A poll really is a measure of where opinion stands at the time that the poll was taken."" Although it’s inevitable that people will look at polls today as a prediction of where the race will end up months from now, that’s not the right way to look at it, he said. Instead, polls ""capture the dynamics of a campaign,"" he said. Johnson’s run in 2016 is one of Franklin’s favorite examples of that. ""I think the polling captured the dynamics of that race extremely well, showing Johnson starting out trailing, but showing him running an effective campaign that closed the margin consistently, and ultimately put him in a position to win,"" he said. Polls do get ""better as predictors as you get later in the campaign,"" Franklin said, and especially in the last two or three weeks. But even then, they’re not infallible. Our ruling Johnson said he saw early polls that were ""wildly incorrect"" during each of his three statewide runs. The heart of Johnson's claim is accurate: Polls showed him trailing in the early months, despite pulling off a victory each time. That was most clear in 2016. When Johnson said not to trust the early polls, he wasn’t suggesting there was something wrong with the polling methodology itself. Instead, he’s getting at the idea that his polls didn’t match the final outcome. Still, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the polls were ""wildly incorrect."" Polls aren’t supposed to predict the final election outcome, but show a snapshot of the campaign in time. Our definition of Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here. "

On the campaign trail in 2016, he sometimes said ""Lock her up"" — a frequent chant of his 2016 rallygoers . In other instances, he made other statements in favor of her going to jail. The ""Lock her up"" chant related to Clinton’s use of a private email address for exchanges with her State Department staff while she was secretary of state. The FBI investigated but Clinton was never charged. The FBI said in findings that classified information had been improperly transmitted, but carelessness, not an intent to skirt the law, was the cause.

Days before the 2016 election, Trump floated the possibility of Clinton serving in office while facing charges. ""If she were to win this election, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. In that situation, we could very well have a sitting president under felony indictment and ultimately a criminal trial. It would grind government to a halt."" Trump broke his promise to investigate Hillary Clinton Trump campaigned on a promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton, but he broke that promise . The closest thing to an investigation of Clinton's emails was released publicly in October 2019, but it was actually a probe that began before Trump was elected president. A three-year investigation by the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security found that there was no widespread mishandling of classified information. Despite encouraging the ""Lock her up"" chants, Trump hinted in the weeks following his 2016 win that he would let the whole thing go.

"May 31, 2024",X posts,Photo shows the judges who will hear the appeal of former President Donald Trump’s criminal conviction.,false,"Former President Donald Trump was convicted on 34 criminal felony counts. He is expected to appeal, but experts told PolitiFact it is impossible to know now exactly which New York justices might hear his appeal of the ruling. If Trump files for appeal, experts say the case likely would go to New York’s Appellate Division, First Department. It is likely a five-justice panel from the First Department will be randomly selected to hear the appeal, but that won’t happen until after Trump’s lawyers have filed it. There are 21 judges in the First Department, any of whom could be tapped. This photo shows five of them. Chances are statistically slim those exact five would be picked.","During a May 31 press conference, former President Donald Trump said he plans to appeal his conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Even before he announced that intent, however, some people speculated about which justices might hear a Trump appeal. ""The appeals court,"" one X user wrote , sharing a photo of five African American women in judicial robes. ""I’m thinking the appeal won’t go well."" The conservative X account Hodgetwins reshared that post , echoing the sentiment, ""Trump is screwed on appeal."" The photo spread beyond conservative accounts. Liberal commentator and podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen also shared the viral photo of the five justices, though he did not echo the claim that the demographics of the photographed justices would affect the outcome of Trump’s appeal. ""New: Trump’s appeal oral arguments will take place in front of the first all-Black women appellate bench,"" he wrote on X May 31. (Screenshots from X.) Claims that the photo shows the justices who will hear Trump’s appeal are inaccurate. Experts told PolitiFact it is impossible to know now which New York justices might hear Trump’s appeal. Legal experts familiar with New York’s appellate system said that because the case is a Manhattan case, a randomly selected panel of justices from New York’s Appellate Division, First Department would hear Trump’s appeal. The Appellate Division’s First Judicial Department includes 21 justices of the court, according to its website. They include 13 women and eight men, all from various racial and ethnic backgrounds. The five justices in the viral photo — from left , justices Bahaati Pitt-Burke, Troy K. Webber, Presiding Justice Dianne T. Renwick, Tanya R. Kennedy and Marsha D. Michael — are on the court. But there’s no guarantee these five justices would hear an appeal. A panel of four or five, but most likely five, judges would be selected to hear the case, according to Daniel A. Warshawsky, a professor at New York Law School who worked in the Office of the Appellate Defender for 15 years. ""The panel of judges that will hear and decide Trump’s appeal gets selected after the briefs are in and before oral argument,"" said Sam Feldman, an attorney who specializes in criminal appeals in New York City. ""It’s a random process. There’s no way to know now who will be on that panel."" Brooklyn Law School professor Cynthia Godsoe agreed with Feldman. The most we can know right now, she said, is that the justices will likely be selected from the pool of First Department justices, unless the case gets moved for some reason — for example, Trump’s team petitions for it to be moved somewhere else. ""It’s just a pure jurisdiction thing,"" Godsoe said. Trump’s legal team ""could file to move it, like they tried to move the trial, but (it’d be) highly unlikely, especially for an appeal,"" she said. The First Department shared this photo of five judges in a Feb. 14, 2024, press release that acknowledged the first time oral arguments before the Appellate Division’s First Department were heard ""by an all African-American bench."" PolitiFact contacted the court and received no response before deadline. The appeals process will likely take time, experts said. ""After sentencing, his lawyers will file a notice of appeal,"" Feldman said. ""Then the appeal needs to be briefed, which can take many months."" Trump’s lawyers will file a brief, the prosecution will file a responding brief and then Trump’s lawyers can file a reply, he explained. After that, the case would be scheduled for oral argument. ""In an ordinary case it can take years between sentencing and oral argument in the appeal,"" Feldman said. ""Even if things move quicker in Trump’s case, I would be very surprised if the oral argument occurred before 2025."" Godsoe said that it was probably statistically unlikely that the justices in the viral photo shared by social media users would be the ones randomly selected to hear Trump’s case. With 21 justices, more than 20,000 different five-person panels could be randomly generated, statisticians confirmed to PolitiFact. If they were, however, Godsoe said she knew of no reason they wouldn’t be impartial justices. There are ethics policies in place that help ensure justices can rule on cases without bias. And there’s nothing inherent in a person’s race or gender that means they will not, Godsoe said: ""White men hear claims by people who are very different from them all the time."" ""If there’s a conflict of interest or even an appearance of impropriety, (justices) could recuse themselves or be required to recuse themselves,"" Godsoe said. That means Trump would get five randomly assigned judges from the First Department, ""but if somehow one of them had a conflict, then they would be off the five and they’d put someone else, randomly, on."" Our ruling Social media users shared a photo they said showed the justices who will rule on Trump’s appeal. The group justices who will rule on Trump’s appeal will not be assigned until Trump’s legal team has filed an appeal and briefs have been filed, experts told PolitiFact. It’s possible the justices in the photo would be randomly selected to hear Trump’s appeal, but that has not been determined. They are among 21 people who could be chosen for a four- or five-person panel and chances are statistically slim those exact five would be picked.

"May 31, 2024",Social Media,"Under federal law, former President Donald Trump’s “felony convictions mean he can no longer possess guns.”",true,"Federal law prohibits people with felony convictions from possessing or acquiring firearms. Former President Donald Trump is also prohibited from possessing a gun under state laws in Florida, where he lives, and in New York, where he was convicted. Trump has said in the past that he owns guns, but it’s unclear whether he does in 2024.","After a jury found former President Donald Trump guilty on 34 felony counts, some social media users pointed to how this conviction affects his Second Amendment rights. A May 30 X post said, ""Under federal law, Trump's felony convictions mean he can no longer possess guns."" Other social media posts made similar claims, drawing more than 1,000 engagements each. Giffords Law Center, which advocates for gun violence prevention; Jobin Joseph, an attorney with New York law firm Rosenblum Law ; and Adam Winkler, a University of California, Los Angeles, law professor, told PolitiFact this statement is accurate. Federal law generally prohibits the possession of firearms by, and the sale of firearms to, a person convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment of more than one year — typically a felony. Because of these felony convictions, Trump is also barred from possessing a gun under state laws in Florida , where he lives, and in New York , where he was convicted, according to Giffords Law Center. People convicted of a felony in New York can have their gun rights restored in some cases. Because Trump’s 34 felony counts were all Class E, meaning they are less severe crimes, he would be eligible for gun rights restoration. To restore his gun rights, Trump could apply for a "" Certificate of Relief from Disabilities "" so long as his 34 felony counts are considered part of the same criminal occurrence, Joseph said. If Trump were convicted of additional felonies in another court case, Joseph said, then he would have to take a different approach and apply for a ""Certificate of Good Conduct,"" after a waiting period dependent on the crime’s severity. Trump was not convicted of these felony counts in Florida, so he could not regain his gun rights under that state’s law . In a 2012 Washington Times interview , Trump said that he had a concealed carry permit in New York City and he owns ""a couple of different guns,"" including a ""H&K (Heckler & Koch) .45 and a .38 Smith & Wesson."" In 2016, Trump told a French publication that he ""always"" carries a weapon. It’s unclear whether Trump still owns firearms. In 2023, Trump visited a gun store in South Carolina, but did not buy any firearms. We rate the claim that under federal law, Trump’s ""felony convictions mean he can no longer possess guns"" True. "
"• May 31,",Jason Pizzo,“Trump can’t vote for himself in the November election.”,barely-true,"Former President Donald Trump was convicted by a Manhattan, New York, jury May 30 of 34 felonies. His sentencing is set for July 11. Trump’s sentence could be stayed pending an appeal. In Trump’s home state of Florida, where he is registered to vote, the Department of State website says that ""a felony conviction in another state makes a person ineligible to vote in Florida only if the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted."" New York restores the right to vote for people convicted of felonies upon release from imprisonment. If people convicted of felonies are not imprisoned, they remain eligible to vote.","Former President and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s felony conviction in New York raised questions about what comes next. Trump can still run for president , but claims about his voting eligibility followed the May 30 verdict. ""Trump can’t vote for himself in the November election,"" Florida state Sen. Jason Pizzo, D-Sunny Isles Beach, wrote on X after the verdict. ""He can thank Florida Republicans for that."" Pizzo’s X post received a corrective, crowdsourced community note detailing what legal experts have previously told us : Trump likely would not lose his voting rights. Many legal experts, including the Campaign Legal Center , a nonprofit group that supports voting rights, said Trump’s ability to vote hinges on whether he is in prison on Election Day. Trump can’t vote for himself in the November election. He can thank Florida Republicans for that. — Sen. Jason Pizzo (@senpizzo) May 30, 2024 Trump’s sentencing is scheduled for July 11. Many legal experts have expressed doubt that Trump will be sentenced to prison because the charge is a nonviolent, low-level felony and he has no previous convictions. ""We are going to be appealing this scam,"" Trump said at a May 31 press conference at Trump Tower in New York. It is widely expected that the appeal process will extend beyond Election Day. When we contacted Pizzo for comment, he said Trump would not have the right to vote until all the terms of his sentence had been satisfied, citing Florida law. We found that Florida defers to other states’ laws when the conviction is in their jurisdiction. Pizzo also acknowledged that Trump can vote while appealing his conviction. ""Sen. Pizzo's statement holds true for someone convicted of a felony in Florida or in federal court — but Trump was convicted in state court in New York,"" Blair Bowie, director of the Restore Your Vote program at the Campaign Legal Center, told PolitiFact. ""Trump will not lose his right to vote in this case unless he is in prison on Election Day."" Florida’s law about voting after a felony conviction States pass laws about whether people convicted of felonies lose their voting rights and if so, how they can regain them. Trump lives in Florida. People convicted in Florida of most felonies lose their voting rights until they serve their entire sentence, including prison time, probation and paying fines, according to the Florida Department of State . (Murder and sexual offense felonies make people ineligible to vote unless the State Clemency Board restores their rights.) However, Trump was convicted in New York. And according to Florida’s Department of State, ""a felony conviction in another state makes a person ineligible to vote in Florida only if the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted."" New York law passed a 2021 law that restores voting rights for people convicted of felonies upon their release from prison. People convicted of felonies don’t lose the right to vote unless they are in prison serving their sentences. And people whose prison sentences are stayed pending appeal do not lose their voting rights, Kathleen R. McGrath, a New York state Board of Elections spokesperson, told PolitiFact . After Trump is sentenced, it is highly likely his lawyers will file a motion to the appeals court asking that the sentence be stayed during the appeal. In 99% of cases involving white-collar defendants, that motion is granted, said Evan Gotlob, a former local and federal prosecutor. ""Former President Trump would therefore need to be actually incarcerated during the time of the November election to lose his ability to vote,"" said Neil Volz , the deputy director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the group that advocated for Florida’s 2018 constitutional amendment restoring felon voting rights. University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald , an expert on disenfranchisement of people convicted of felonies, told PolitiFact, ""Trump may, in fact, be removed from the voter rolls but it seems highly unlikely he will be removed by November."" ""The most reasonable scenario here is that Trump remains on the voter rolls,"" McDonald said. ""He could be sentenced to prison, and he could be serving time by the time we get to November, I guess I can’t rule out that possibility, but it seems like a very remote possibility."" In 2018, Floridians voted in favor of the amendment that restores the voting rights of people with felony convictions after those people complete the terms of their sentences. Previously, people with felony convictions had to seek to regain their voting rights through the state clemency board . Florida state officials, including from the Department of State, have not responded to PolitiFact’s questions about Trump’s voting rights. Trump is a registered voter in Palm Beach County. Our ruling Pizzo said, ""Trump can’t vote for himself in the November election."" This is premature and against the odds. The Florida Department of State says a felony conviction in another state invalidates the right to vote in Florida only if ""the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted."" That means New York’s laws would apply to Trump. In that state, people convicted of felonies lose the right to vote only while incarcerated. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced July 11. Even if he receives prison time — which many legal experts said they think is unlikely — it would be stayed pending an appeal that is likely to extend beyond Election Day. Pizzo’s statement contains an element of truth because it cannot be ruled out that Trump would be incarcerated on Election Day and therefore unable to vote for himself. But the statement ignores critical facts that would give a different impression: Trump has said he will appeal his conviction. This would stay his sentence until the appeal is complete — widely expected to be after Election Day. We rate this statement Mostly False.  "

The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Other Instagram posts made similar claims. The District of Columbia noncitizen voter registration form pictured in the Instagram video includes information telling noncitizen prospective voters that they ""must be a United States citizen to vote in federal elections."" The form also lists the specific elections noncitizens are eligible to participate in, but that section of the form is not shown in the Instagram photo. The District of Columbia Board of Elections website also states that ""non-citizens cannot vote for federal offices."" A screenshot of the full District of Columbia noncitizen voter registration form Noncitizens who live in Washington, D.C., gained the right to vote from a 2022 law passed by the Council of the District of Columbia, the local legislative body. Mayor Muriel Bowser approved the law, which took effect Feb. 23, 2023. The Instagram post mentions ""a bill passed during the Obama (administration);"" President Barack Obama’s second and final presidential term ended in January 2017. In the United States’ capital, resident noncitizens can vote only in local elections for positions including mayor, attorney general, city council member, State Board of Education member or Advisory Neighborhood Commission member. Noncitizens can also vote on local referendums, ballot initiatives and recalls. As of April 30, 372 noncitizen residents had registered to vote, according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections. With 450,750 total registered voters as of that date, noncitizens comprised less than 1% of the district’s registered voters. As of May 29, the number of registered noncitizen voters had increased to 523, Sarah Winn Graham, Board of Elections communications director, wrote in an email to PolitiFact. Latest figures for total registered voters as of the end of May will be published in early June, she added. The first local election in which noncitizens are eligible to vote will take place June 4. The law also lets immigrants in the U.S. illegally who are living in Washington, D.C., vote in these local elections. The elections body does not track the immigration status of registered noncitizen voters, Graham said. Other cities that allow noncitizen residents to vote in local elections and referendums include San Francisco (school board elections only), Hyattsville, Maryland , and Burlington, Vermont . Noncitizens cannot vote in federal elections in the District of Columbia or anywhere else in the U.S. A 1996 law passed by Congress explicitly banned noncitizens from voting in federal elections such as for president, U.S. senators or the House of Representatives. Although the District of Columbia is not a U.S. state, it conducts some federal-level elections for ""a non-voting delegate to the US House of Representatives, two shadow Senators, and one shadow Representative whose task is to petition Congress for statehood."" None of these representatives have any voting power in the U.S. legislature. However in U.S. presidential elections, its residents have three Electoral College votes . PolitiFact has found that voting by noncitizens is rare and not enough to change the outcome of federal elections. Registered noncitizen voters in the District of Columbia receive only ballots marked ""local"" and ""voter information is stored in a separate component within our Voter Focus database system and the physical voter registration form is a different color (yellow),"" Graham said.

"May 24, 2024",Instagram posts,"Bird flu in the U.S. is a ""scamdemic"" timed to coincide with the 2024 presidential elections “by design.”",false,"The current H5N1 bird flu outbreak has spread to cows at dozens of dairy herds in nine U.S. states. The U.S. outbreak was first reported among wild birds in 2022, and has infected more than 92 million birds. The first description of bird flu in history dates to 1878 in northern Italy and the H5N1 strain was first found in 1996 in southern China. Three human cases have been reported in this outbreak. Human cases of bird flu are rare, and no human-to-human transmission has been reported in the current outbreak.","World Health Organization Chief Scientist Dr. Jeremy Farrar expressed concern in an April 18 news conference about an outbreak of the bird flu, known as H5N1, at U.S. dairy farms. He urged health officials to better monitor and prepare in case the virus evolves and begins spreading among humans. At least three U.S. farm workers have been infected with the virus, but there’s no evidence of human-to-human transmission, Farrar said, calling it a ""global zoonotic animal pandemic."" Nevertheless, some social media users are using his words and other bird flu news to suggest that unknown actors are planning a new pandemic in an election year. ""Tell me the Presidential elections coming up without telling me Presidential elections coming up,"" a May 12 Instagram post said in sticker text on a video of Farrar speaking about avian influenza. The post noted that 70 people In Colorado are ""under surveillance for having potentially contracted bird flu,"" and included the hashtags #WAKEUPAMERICA, #BYDESIGN AND #SCAMDEMIC. It’s unclear how the poster thinks a bird flu pandemic would affect the U.S. elections in November. But the claim echoes similar widely debunked claims that elites planned the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, also an election year. Some of them said COVID-19 was created to hurt former President Donald Trump’s chances at re-election. We found multiple examples of social media users — some using the same video of Farrar — tying the bird flu news to the upcoming election and suggesting unnamed forces are using the virus to spread fear and exert control. This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Instagram screenshot) The Instagram post shared clips of Farrar at the April 18 WHO news conference in Geneva., responding to a question about the bird flu virus that has spread globally, infecting dairy cows in the U.S. The H5N1 virus has been found in U.S. birds since 2022 and has infected more than 92 million birds in 48 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The virus has spread to mammals, with outbreaks reported in dozens of dairy herds in nine states. But there is no bird flu pandemic in the U.S., at least among humans. Farrar urged strong surveillance of the virus so health officials can be prepared with vaccines and therapeutics should it evolve to spread between humans. ""The great concern, of course, is that in doing so and infecting ducks and chickens — but now increasingly mammals — that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans. And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,"" he said. Avian influenza is not a planned or engineered virus. It occurs naturally among wild birds, such as ducks and geese that can also infect domestic birds, such as chickens and turkeys, and mammals. Highly pathogenic strains of the virus can cause severe infection and death in birds. There have been global bird flu outbreaks in animals throughout the years, including in the U.S. in 2014-15 . The first description of the bird flu was in 1878 in northern Italy. The H5N1 strain was first found in waterfowl in China in 1996. Human cases of bird flu are rare , but have occurred globally for nearly three decades, the CDC said. The virus is frequently lethal to humans — about 52% of the 887 people diagnosed with the virus worldwide since 2004 have died, the WHO said. The CDC said the risk is low for humans and that the risk depends on exposure to infected animals. Thus far, only two people — a Texas dairy farm worker in April and a Michigan farm worke r in May — have been infected with the bird flu linked to dairy farms; each had reported mild symptoms. An earlier human case was diagnosed in a Colorado poultry farm worker in 2022. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment told CBS News earlier this month that about 70 dairy farm workers from two farms were being monitored for bird flu symptoms after being exposed to the virus. A claim that the bird flu outbreak in the U.S. is being planned to affect the U.S. presidential elections ignores that the H5N1 virus occurs naturally and that bird flu has existed for more than a century. The H5N1 strain was first found in 1996 in southern China. The current outbreak affecting dairy cattle emerged in the U.S. in 2022. The claim is False. "

Biden was “locked and loaded” and “ready to take me out.”,pants-fire,"An FBI operations order for the search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, included language about the Justice Department’s lethal force policy. The policy says that officers ""may use deadly force only when necessary,"" such as when a subject poses an imminent danger of death or physical injury. The FBI said it followed standard protocol in the search, which includes a standard statement about the use of deadly force. Former FBI agents told PolitiFact it’s standard to include such a policy statement.","Former President Donald Trump in a May 21 campaign email and social media posts falsely accused President Joe Biden of putting his life at risk in an August 2022 FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago. ""BREAKING FROM TRUMP: BIDEN’S DOJ WAS AUTHORIZED TO SHOOT ME!"" read an all-caps subject line on an email from Trump’s campaign. ""It’s just been revealed that Biden’s DOJ was authorized to use DEADLY FORCE for their DESPICABLE raid in Mar-a-Lago. You know they’re just itching to do the unthinkable…Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger,"" the email said. Trump made similar claims in posts on Truth Social and Instagram , saying he ""was shown reports"" that ""Biden’s DOJ"" authorized the FBI to use deadly force in the Mar-a-Lago raid, calling Biden a ""serious threat to democracy."" Trump’s Republican congressional allies Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., accused Biden of planning to assassinate Trump and ordering a hit on him. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., in an X post called it a ""weaponization of government"" against Trump by his top political opponent. Social media users also shared Trump’s claim about deadly force being authorized . DC_Draino, a prominent conservative X account, said in a May 22 X post with more than 800,000 views that Attorney General Merrick Garland ""wanted a shootout"" at Mar-a-Lago. Trump faces 40 federal charges in a federal case over his handling of classified documents. The claim takes Trump’s rhetoric about a politicized Justice Department investigation to new levels by invoking a threat of violence. Trump was not at Mar-a-Lago during the search. He was residing in his Bedminster, New Jersey, home, and was at Trump Tower in New York when the search happened, ABC News reported . Lawyers in Trump’s criminal trial and a campaign spokesperson did not return PolitiFact’s request for comment. Trump’s comments followed reports by the New York Post and Fox News about newly unsealed documents in the federal classified documents criminal trial. In a February court filing, Trump’s attorneys made a motion to suppress evidence found in the search. Trump’s attorneys in that motion referred to an FBI ""operations order"" that included a policy statement about the ""use of deadly force."" The statement, according to Trump’s lawyers, said ""law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary."" That summary of the statement is different from what the FBI said and omits language that limits when deadly force can be used. The operations order included a policy statement on the use of deadly force, dated July 19, 2022. It said, ""Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person."" Similar language is found on the Justice Department's online manual and an FBI frequently asked questions webpage . The operations order also included language saying that the Justice Department and FBI would notify Trump's attorney the morning of the search and request collaboration and assistance. It said that the search would require coordination with the Secret Service and Mar-a-Lago guest services. It also noted that team leaders and on-scene command should be dressed in business attire and that case agents would be dressed in business casual attire with unmarked Polo or collared shirts, and that law enforcement equipment, including weapons and handcuffs, would be concealed. The FBI said in an emailed statement to PolitiFact that it ""followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter."" FBI experts told PolitiFact that law enforcement officers always have the authority to use deadly force if needed, and it’s typical for the FBI to include that written policy in an operations order, such as the Mar-a-Lago search. The FBI also searched Biden's home in January and the Penn Biden Center in November after Biden's lawyers reported finding classified documents from his time as vice president. The FBI also searched former Republican Vice President Mike Pence's Indiana home in February 2023 after Pence reported finding a small number of classified documents. Neither Biden nor Pence were charged in those cases. It's not clear whether operations orders were created in those cases as both searches were voluntary. The FBI did not respond to a question about those searches. David Shapiro, a former FBI special agent and a lecturer and program director at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the ""potential need to use deadly force can arise in any FBI operation,"" even if it's consensual. He said the agents’ weapons were concealed in the Mar-a-Lago search and likely would have also been in searches of Biden's or Pence's homes and offices. Luke William Hunt, a former FBI special agent and a University of Alabama associate philosophy professor, said FBI agents are law enforcement officers who carry firearms as part of their job description. ""So they're always permitted to use deadly force in a way that's consistent with the Constitution and internal policies,"" Hunt said. Hunt said an operations order is standard procedure when the FBI is carrying out any operation, such as a search or arrest warrant. It details everyone's role in the plan, and there's nothing unusual about including the FBI's deadly force policy in the internal document. ""That's simply to reiterate when you can and cannot use deadly force. It's almost like a reminder,"" Hunt said. ""That's just the standard deadly force policy the FBI always has and you would put that in any operations plan."" Shapiro said language about the use of deadly force ""is normally embedded in search warrants for what should be obvious reasons,"" such as the ""risk of conflict escalation initiated by others."" The general policy applied to the Mar-a-Lago search as it would in any operation, Shapiro said. ""The Mar-a-Lago search was ordered to be conducted according to the policies applicable generally to FBI operations,"" Shapiro said. ""Agents facing a credible imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm to themselves, or others, were properly advised that the Mar-a-Lago search would be executed without any exceptional limitations unnecessarily endangering themselves or others."" Our ruling Trump said ""Biden’s DOJ"" was authorized to use deadly force and was ""ready to take me out"" in its raid of Mar-a-Lago. An FBI operations order Trump’s attorneys referred to in a court filing included language about the department’s deadly force policy — which Trump, his legal team and online supporters took out of context to back their claims the FBI was prepared to shoot Trump. The FBI statement said officers can use deadly force ""only"" when they reasonably believe they or someone else is in imminent danger of death or serious physical injury. This is standard protocol for search warrants. The order did not specify that Trump should be targeted; agents knew he was not at Mar-a-Lago at the time of the search.

The claim that Woodall printed 64,000 ballots and had employees fill them out to favor Joe Biden originated with a Wisconsin man who has filed numerous lawsuits against Wisconsin officials, none of which have produced evidence of this claim. Milwaukee ballots are printed by city vendors, and the city does not have the capability to print 64,000 ballots, the mayoral spokesperson said.","Six months before the 2024 presidential election, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson replaced the head of the city’s election commission. The change had social media users claiming the change was motivated by the discovery of fraudulent activity in the 2020 election. Johnson on May 6 replaced Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall, nominating her deputy, Paulina Gutiérrez, to replace her. A May 6 X post alleged that Woodall had been fired after printing ballots and recruiting employees to fill them out. ""Recently FIRED Claire Woodall-Vogg printed 64,000 ballots in a back room at City Hall in Milwaukee and had random employees fill them out. Miraculously Biden took the lead in the middle of the night,"" said the post, which had been viewed more than 410,000 times as of May 21. ""64,000 ballots. The margin in the presidential election was 20,000!!!"" In a reply to her X post, the user shared a separate X post from a Wisconsin man who accused Woodall of ""printing ballots in the back conference room. That man filed a 2021 lawsuit against Woodall, alleging she and others printed ballots in a back room at City Hall in fall 2020. We found multiple social media posts and conservative media articles and videos making similar allegations about Woodall, some of them also citing the 64,000 ballot figure. There are some unknowns about why Woodall was replaced, according to reporting by PolitiFact’s partners at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. But there’s no evidence that Woodall printed tens of thousands of ballots in a back room and had workers fill them out. A spokesperson for Milwaukee’s mayor told PolitiFact that Woodall was not replaced for any improper conduct related to the 2020 election. Jeff Fleming, a Johnson spokesperson, told PolitiFact that Woodall did nothing improper in the 2020 election. The 2021 civil lawsuit that alleged she did is not connected to the mayor’s decision, he said. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have long baselessly claimed that Trump won the Wisconsin vote in 2020 and that there was election fraud found that tipped the state’s election to Biden. Neither claim is accurate, PolitiFact has reported . Biden won statewide by nearly 20,700 votes. Many conspiracy theories about Wisconsin’s election stem from absentee votes being added to the tally late at night. Wisconsin law does not allow clerks to process absentee ballots until polls open on Election Day, so many Milwaukee votes were reported late on election night and early the next morning. Why was Woodall replaced? When news of Woodall’s replacement broke, Johnson didn’t give a reason for the change when he responded to news reporters ’ questions, but he did say she wasn’t fired. He said she had been offered another position that she chose not to accept. ""There was absolutely no evidence, indication, or credible information of any improper action related to the conduct of elections or the counting of votes,"" Fleming said. Fleming said Woodall remains on the city payroll in support of the election commission for at least the next two months. He said that Johnson also made leadership changes in two other cabinet positions, which state law allows a mayor to do upon inauguration for a new term, which happened April 16. Woodall told PolitiFact the mayor ""decided to go a different direction with his appointment."" She did not accept the other position, she said, because it did not yet exist and hadn’t been formally approved. There were many details to still be worked out, she said. ""I decided it was best for us to focus on a transition plan and to seek new opportunities outside of city employment after I assist with this transition,"" Woodall said. Election workers, right, verify ballots as recount observers, left, watch Nov. 20, 2020, during a Milwaukee hand recount of presidential votes at the Wisconsin Center. (AP) The 64,000 question The 64,000 figure appears to have originated with a Wisconsin man named Peter Bernegger, who has referred to it in other X posts . Bernegger was convicted of bank and mail fraud in Mississippi in 2009, unrelated to any elections. In February, Wisconsin prosecutors accused Bernegger of falsifying a 2023 subpoena in an election-related case, and he was charged with ""simulating legal process,"" a felony . There’s a preliminary hearing for Bernegger scheduled for June 20. The Wisconsin Elections Commission in 2022 fined Bernegger more than $2,400 for making frivolous election complaints. He has filed at least 18 lawsuits against Wisconsin election officials alleging fraud. We reached out to Bernegger by email through his organization, Election Watch , but received no response. Woodall said she doesn’t know how Bernegger arrived at ""this magical 64,000 number."" ""I can assure you I did not print 64,000 ballots and that does not appear in the deposition,"" Woodall said. Bernegger filed a 2021 open records lawsuit against Woodall. Although the lawsuit didn’t refer to the 64,000 figure, he accused Woodall and others of printing ballots in a City Hall conference room. That number did come up in Woodall's April 13, 2022, deposition in that case, provided to PolitiFact by Milwaukee Assistant City Attorney Peter Block. But it wasn’tin the context Bernegger described in his X post . Bernegger asked about an absentee ballot application, which Woodall said are used for voters seeking in-person absentee ballots. Bernegger asked how many were accepted by Woodall's office in the November 2020 election, and she said between 60,000 and 64,000. She did not, however, say anything about printing those ballots in a City Hall back room. Block said the Milwaukee County Circuit Court ruled against Bernegger and dismissed the case last year, but Bernegger has appealed to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, which has not reached a decision. Fleming said it’s not physically or logistically possible for the city to print 64,000 ballots in a back room at City Hall. ""The city does not maintain commercial printing capabilities, which would be needed to print tens-of-thousands of ballots,"" he said. All ballots are printed by city vendors, unless a ward exceeds anticipated turnout, Fleming said. In those cases, small batches of new ballots can be printed, he said. ""There would be dozens printed, not the thousands that are falsely claimed,"" Fleming said. Our ruling An X post claimed the Milwaukee Election Commission’s executive director was fired after she ""printed 64,000 ballots in a back room at City Hall in Milwaukee and had random employees fill them out,"" giving Biden a lead in the 2020 election. The 64,000 figure originated from an X post by a man who has been convicted of fraud and currently faces felony charges in Wisconsin of simulating a legal process. He has filed at least 18 lawsuits against Wisconsin election officials and has been fined by a state commission for making frivolous claims. None of them have produced evidence that Woodall printed 64,000 ballots. A mayoral spokesperson said Woodall was not replaced as director because of any improper conduct during the election, and that the city lacks the capability to print that many ballots. We rate this claim False. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this fact-check. "
"• May 20,",Mike Johnson,“The millions (of immigrants) that have been paroled can simply go to their local welfare office or the DMV and register to vote.”,false,"Only U.S. citizens may vote in federal elections. Congress banned noncitizen voting in federal elections in 1996. People in the U.S. under humanitarian parole are legally in the country and are eligible for certain public benefits, but they are not U.S. citizens. If people apply to register to vote, they must attest to being citizens under penalty of perjury and election officials vet the application.","U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson is promoting a bill that he says will ensure only U.S. citizens can vote. He says that although the practice is already banned, the government has not established safeguards to prevent it from happening. Noncitizen voting poses a ""clear and present danger to the integrity of our election system,"" Johnson said May 8 during a press conference as he advocated for the ""Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act."" Johnson, R-La., referred to voter registration forms that ask applicants to check a box noting that they are U.S. citizens. ""If a nefarious actor wants to intervene in our elections, all they have to do is check a box on a form and sign their name,"" Johnson said . ""That's it. That's all that's required. And there's a very small chance that illegal would get caught."" President Joe Biden has ""welcomed millions and millions of illegal aliens"" and ""the millions that have been paroled can simply go to their local welfare office or the DMV and register to vote,"" Johnson said. Are millions of people who came in under humanitarian parole able to register to vote? The Biden administration has admitted about 1 million people into the U.S. through different humanitarian parole programs that grant people temporary legal permission to live and work in the United States. But the people participating in these programs are not U.S. citizens, and it would be a crime for them to register to vote in federal elections. In 1996, Congress banned noncitizen voting in federal elections as part of a broader toughening of penalties for people in the country illegally. States banned it decades earlier. ""Noncitizens"" includes people legally and illegally in the U.S. Safeguards already exist to prevent noncitizen voting. Think tanks, academics , courts and journalists have analyzed claims about noncitizen voting for years and have found only sporadic cases that wouldn’t swing federal elections. Johnson did not say how many noncitizens had illegally voted. ""We all know, intuitively, that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections. But it’s not been something that is easily provable,"" Johnson said at the May 8 press conference. ""We don’t have that number."" The Republican bill would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. However, in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in an Arizona case that states must permit people to register for federal elections using a federal form that does not require documentary proof of citizenship. States may have their own form, but they must also accept the federal form. People’s eligibility for public benefits or driver’s licenses doesn’t mean they’re allowed to register to vote. Humanitarian parole beneficiaries qualify for certain federal benefits, such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid and Medicare. But to qualify for the benefits, many need to have lived in the U.S. with parole, or another qualifying status, for at least five years. Once they’re in the U.S., parole program participants must apply for a legal status, such as asylum. Generally, people under humanitarian parole programs qualify for driver’s licenses , though rules vary by state. Still, only U.S. citizens can register to vote. A Johnson spokesperson pointed us to a news article about a letter a South Carolina state representative sent the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division requesting an investigation after a refugee received voter registration forms at the South Carolina Medicaid Office. But receiving a voter registration form does not mean someone is registered to vote, John Michael Catalano, South Carolina State Election Commission’s public information officer told PolitiFact. The commission told PolitiFact it found no incidents in which non-U.S. citizens with state IDs or driver’s licenses had voted. A South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said even though the agency provides voter registration forms, the state’s election commission reviews them. The news article mentioned the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 , which says that any office providing public assistance must offer voter registration. However, the law also says voter registration applications must specify that only citizens can register and applicants must affirm that they are citizens under penalty of perjury. ""This affirmation is a big deal — not just ‘checking a box’ like Speaker Johnson suggested,"" said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the Brennan Center Voting Rights Program at New York University school of law. ""Making a false claim of citizenship on a voter registration form is a federal criminal offense that carries steep penalties, including deportation."" Fraudulent voter registration is often a result of misunderstandings or errors. For example, some noncitizens accidentally register to vote when applying for a driver’s license. But the number of people who fall into this category is ""minuscule,"" Rutgers University political science professor Lorraine Minnite previously told us . Nationwide, from 2020 to 2022 about 55% of voter registrations forms were filled out at motor vehicle departments, the Election Assistance Commission data shows. About 1.4% of voter registration applications came from public assistance offices. The other registrations were largely submitted online, via mail or in person. What some states do to verify voting eligibility The federal database Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE , lets states check someone’s immigration or citizenship status. But only a few use it to check for voter registration purposes. Georgia found that there were 1,634 noncitizens who tried to register to vote over 25 years — there were about 7 million on the voter rolls in 2022 when the state released this data. But none of the 1,634 were registered. States often use driver’s license records to vet eligibility, but this method isn’t foolproof . People illegally in the country can get driver’s licenses in some states . Also, noncitizens driver’s licenses may later become naturalized citizens. Our ruling Johnson said ""the millions (of immigrants) that have been paroled can simply go to their local welfare office or the DMV and register to vote."" About 1 million people have entered the U.S. during the Biden administration through humanitarian parole programs. Some of them can qualify for driver’s licenses and public benefits. And motor-vehicle departments and public benefit offices must provide people with voter registration forms under a federal law. But it is illegal for people under humanitarian parole to register to vote because they are not U.S. citizens. If a noncitizen granted parole submits a voter registration application, election officials would vet it; just submitting a form doesn’t automatically register a person to vote. Noncitizen voting is rare and Johnson provided no data to prove it’s a widespread problem. We rate this statement False.  "
"May 16, 2024",Facebook posts,“Voter fraud investigations are being banned by Michigan lawmakers!”,false,"Michigan election officials, a Michigan state senator, a Michigan attorney general’s office spokesperson and a voting rights group executive director all told PolitiFact that they know of no proposed legislation that would ban ""voter fraud investigations."" If it becomes law, Michigan Senate Bill 603 will amend the state’s procedures for election recounts. It would also put in statute that a recount ""is not an investigation or an audit of the conduct of an election,"" aiming to end frivolous recounts. The bill’s sponsor and county clerks who helped draft the legislation said it aims to clarify and improve recount procedures and will not prevent investigation of voter fraud allegations. The bill’s critics argue it would remove one method of investigating potential fraud.","In Michigan, a battleground state, elections have been scrutinized in recent years, and this year’s presidential election will be no exception. That’s likely one reason a proposed change to Michigan’s election laws is garnering social media attention. ""Voter fraud investigations are being banned by Michigan lawmakers!"" read a May 4 Facebook post . The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. We searched Google for ""voter fraud investigations,"" ""ban"" and ""Michigan"" and found a May 2 article by the conservative news website The Daily Wire. It said Michigan Senate Bill 603 would ""ban bipartisan election boards from investigating voter fraud."" That bill passed the Democratic-controlled Michigan Senate on April 30 without Republican support . If it becomes law, S.B. 603 will amend Michigan’s procedures for election recounts, with a goal of prohibiting recounts when the outcome could not change the election results. During the 2022 midterm elections, Michigan voters approved constitutional amendments related to abortion access and voting rights by hundreds of thousands of votes . Nevertheless, a group requested costly recounts that could not change the election outcome; that same group had unsuccessfully tried to decertify Michigan’s 2020 election results because of unproven fraud allegations. The bill would also clarify the definition of a recount, explicitly distinguishing it from an election investigation, and remove some mentions of ""fraud."" We found no indication in the S.B. 603’s text that the measure would prevent investigations of voter fraud allegations. Michigan election officials, a Michigan state senator, a Michigan attorney general’s office spokesperson and a voting rights group executive director all told PolitiFact that they know of no proposed legislation that would ban ""voter fraud investigations."" What does Senate Bill 603 say? State Sen. Stephanie Chang, D-Detroit, who sponsored the bill, said it amends sections of the election code related to recounts, and does not ban investigations of fraud. Michigan law allows candidates who believe that a mistake or discrepancy resulted in an incorrect election result to petition for recounts. ""Recounts are conducted solely to recount the ballots and confirm the results of the election,"" said Lindsay Oswald, county clerk and Register of Deeds for St. Joseph County, Michigan. The bill ""makes process improvements for recounts,"" Oswald, a Republican, said. ""I do not see how it would stop lawful investigations for illegal activity."" S.B. 603 requires candidates who request recounts to ask that the number of votes being recounted exceed the margin of difference by which the election was lost. ""We’ve seen situations where there literally was no possible outcome of a recount that was going to change the results, so then instead county clerks were spending our taxpayer dollars on, essentially, a frivolous recount,"" Chang said. Some inaccurate claims about the bill appeared to stem from the legislation’s definition of ""recount"" and the removal ""fraud or mistake"" as a rationale for requesting a recount. If the measure becomes law, candidates who broadly believe they were ""aggrieved on account of error"" will be able to request recounts. A recount ""is an administrative process limited to determining the number of votes cast on ballots for each candidate seeking a particular office or determining the number of votes cast for or against a ballot question,"" the bill reads. ""A recount is not an investigation or an audit of the conduct of an election, and a recount does not assess the qualifications of electors participating in an election or the manner in which ballots are applied for or issued to electors."" County Clerks from both political parties who helped draft the legislation also distinguished recounts from investigations. The bill ""simply spells out"" that recounts aren’t investigations of voter fraud, ""but rather an available option for candidates or impacted citizens to have the ballots counted to ensure that the results that were certified were correct,"" said Democrat Barb Byrum, Ingham County Clerk. ""I fail to see how voter or election fraud would be discovered by a recount."" Proposed law would remove language about boards of canvassers investigating fraud State Sen. Ruth Johnson, R-Holly, who served two terms as secretary of state, voted against the bill April 30 because it would remove language she said gives ""bipartisan county boards of canvassers in our state the authority to investigate fraud, wrongdoing, or a violation of the law in our elections."" A spokesperson for her office pointed to a portion of law that said the board of canvassers has the power, if there is probable cause, to subpoena witnesses, open ballot boxes and examine ballots. After that, if canvassers had ""good reason to believe"" fraud had occurred, they were responsible for reporting their findings in writing for a prosecutor or judge. S.B. 603 repeals that language. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Christopher Thomas, who served as Michigan’s elections director for 36 years under Democratic and Republican secretaries of state, testified in support of the bill during a May 14 Michigan House hearing . Thomas, who was Board of State Canvassers secretary from 1981 to 2017, said that in practice, boards of canvassers have not conducted fraud investigations. The board’s ""investigatory powers"" expire as soon as a recount is certified, Thomas said, and there is ""no time to conduct an investigation and complete a recount by the timelines required so that the successful candidates can take office."" He also said recount petitioners themselves rarely have time to investigate and allege specific instances of fraud when requesting ballots be retabulated. ""Most petitions that come in are based on the fact that it’s a close election,"" Thomas said. ""Rarely, if ever, that I recall could anybody specify any fraud that they were basing their recount on."" Oswald said that election officials or voters can report suspected election law violations to local law enforcement officials, county prosecutors, the state Bureau of Elections and the attorney general. ""I have never had an investigation triggered by a recount,"" she said, adding that election officials would reach out to the appropriate law enforcement entity for anything ""observed or reported as illegal."" Voters wait in line outside the municipal offices before polls close on Election Day in Shelby Township, Mich., in Macomb County, Nov. 3, 2020. (AP) Law enforcement investigates voter fraud Quentin Turner, executive director of Common Cause Michigan, a voting rights group, said recounts are handled by election administrators who lack the authority to investigate criminal fraud. ""Voter fraud is a crime and investigations into crime can only be done by law enforcement,"" Turner said. Investigations into possible election improprieties ""would be triggered by a report of some manner of illegal activity as defined by Michigan state statute,"" Byrum said. People who suspect voter fraud is occuring can address their concerns ""at the proper time in the proper way,"" Byrum said. ""For instance, there are some who are spreading the false accusation that people are voting who shouldn’t be,"" she said. ""We have election challengers that are nominated by political parties or other organizations who may be present in any precinct location and watch and challenge a voter’s qualifications. The time to do that is not at a recount, which is what this bill clarifies."" During the May 14 House hearing, Joe Rozell, Oakland County elections director, testified in support of the bill and said that people at recounts who observe something they suspect is fraudulent may freely file criminal complaints to law enforcement. A law isn’t required to permit that. In 2018, for example, Rozell said officials suspected a local clerk had committed fraud and, ""absent any statute, we reported it to the secretary of state and the attorney general, there was an investigation, and that election official subsequently plead ‘no contest’ to a felony and was removed from office."" Our ruling A Facebook post says, ""Voter fraud investigations are being banned by Michigan lawmakers!"" Our review found one piece of legislation that would change the scope of one entity that oversees election processes. That legislation, S.B. 603, does not ban voter fraud investigations. Critics noted that Michigan S.B. 603 would strike one provision from existing law that says boards of canvassers can investigate fraud and report it to the appropriate enforcement authority. Michigan election experts said in practice, canvassing boards lack the time to investigate fraud while conducting a recount. And anyone can report suspected fraud to the appropriate authorities — including canvassing board members — even without a statutory obligation. An S.B. 603 bill sponsor and county clerks from both parties said the bill is aimed at clarifying the purpose of recounts, which are to retabulate ballots to ensure that an election’s results are correct — they are not criminal fraud investigations. Law enforcement handles fraud investigations. We rate this claim False. "
"May 15, 2024",Donald Trump,“Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel.”,false,"In May, the United States paused one shipment of weapons to Israel consisting of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs. President Joe Biden said on CNN that if Israel does a full-scale assault on Rafah, ""I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, to deal with that problem."" Biden also said the U.S. will continue to provide aid to Israel.","President Joe Biden’s administration paused one shipment of 3,500 bombs to Israel hoping to prevent a full-scale attack on Gaza — a move that former President Donald Trump condemned. ""Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel,"" Trump said May 10 on Truth Social. ""Any Jewish person who votes for Crooked Joe Biden should have his/her head examined!"" Two days earlier, Biden said on CNN that he would not supply certain offensive weapons if Israel launched a full attack on cities in Rafah, though he would continue to provide military aid. Twenty-six Democrats wrote a letter to National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on May 10 stating they were ""deeply concerned"" about ""withholding weapons shipments to Israel, during a critical moment in the negotiations."" Republican leaders wrote that they were alarmed about the delay in weapons for Israel. But withholding some weapons does not equal immediately cutting off all aid to Israel. Trump’s statement is ""factually completely inaccurate,"" said Aaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former adviser to secretaries of state from both major political parties. Days after Trump’s remark, multiple outlets including the Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post , New York Times, Associated Press and CNN citing anonymous sources, reported that the Biden administration told Congress it was proposing more than $1 billion in weapons agreements for Israel, including tank ammunition, tactical vehicles and mortar rounds. PolitiFact does not use anonymous sources and we were not able to corroborate that reporting. Since these news reports were published after Trump’s remarks, we did not consider them in our rating. We emailed a Trump campaign spokesperson asking for his evidence and received no response by our deadline. U.S. paused one shipment of bombs In his May 8 CNN interview, Biden raised concerns about civilian deaths if Israel uses bombs in heavily populated areas in Rafah. ""If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, to deal with that problem,"" said Biden, who added that he made his position clear to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, Biden said the U.S. was not blocking all weapons for Israel. ""We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure, in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks,"" Biden said. He later added, ""We're not walking away from Israel's security. We're walking away from Israel's ability to wage war in those areas."" Gaza residents have been fleeing their homes and the area, bracing for a full-scale attack. On May 12, the United Nations’ relief agency estimated that 300,000 people had evacuated. The United States paused one shipment of weapons in May consisting of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs. That does not pertain to the bill Biden just signed – it is from funding from years ago. ""This was intended as a tightly scripted pause, one shipment of high value munitions bombs to demonstrate the president’s frustration and concern that the Israelis were mounting a major military campaign against Rafah,"" Miller said. ""The administration has gone out of way in briefings to make clear this is not an arms embargo, nor an open breach of U.S.-Israeli defense commitment."" Barbara Slavin, a distinguished fellow at the Stimson Center, a nonpartisan Washington think tank, and an international affairs lecturer at George Washington University, also said Trump’s statement was wrong. ""All Biden has done is paused the shipment of 2,000 pound bombs,"" Slavin said. ""He has given no indication that he would cut aid and has specifically said defensive aid — missile defense systems in particular — would continue."" Mark Cancian, senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ international security program, agreed with Slavin that Biden’s comments do not equal a total aid cutoff for Israel. But he offered a caveat about the administration describing its action as a ""pause."" ""We can’t be sure it is a pause until they restart it, there is that dangling question,"" he said. The U.S. has given Israel $3 billion to $4 billion a year in military aid during the past decade and a half. This spending was outlined in a 10-year, $38 billion memorandum of understanding the two countries signed in 2016. The memorandum cited several priorities, including updating the Israeli air fleet and maintaining the country’s missile defense system. Similar memorandums were signed under the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations . U.S. has continued providing billions of aid to Israel during Biden’s administration The State Department and Department of Defense both have oversight roles for any U.S aid that Congress appropriates, and the Arms Export Control Act requires that the President notify Congress only of sales above a certain dollar threshold. Once the sales go through, we don’t know exactly when weapons get transferred to Israel. And the process — of aid being provided, sales approved and weapons then arriving in Israel — can take years. The Washington Post reported in March that the U.S. has approved and delivered more than 100 separate foreign military sales to Israel since Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel and the war began. The Post found that only two of those 100 sales have been made public: $106 million in tank ammunition and $147.5 million in components needed to make 155-millimeter artillery shells. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby and White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre gave separate May 9 press briefings in which they said U.S. military aid to Israel will continue. That aid includes the money from the $95 billion foreign aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan that Biden approved in April. The aid package included about $26 billion in Israel-Gaza assistance, including $14.3 billion for military aid to Israel and $9.3 billion for humanitarian aid. When Biden signed the legislation, he said the U.S. ""can help replenish Israel’s air defense and provide other critical defense so Iran can never carry out the destruction it intended with its attack 10 days ago."" Kirby told reporters, ""Weapons shipments are still going to Israel. They’re still getting the vast, vast majority of everything that they need to defend themselves."" Jean-Pierre told reporters, ""We are also committed to ensuring Israel gets every dollar appropriated in the supplemental. In addition, we just approved the latest tranche of foreign military financing, which is $827 million worth of weapons and equipment for Israel."" The foreign military financing was approved May 7. The foreign military financing program lets certain countries, including Israel, buy U.S. defense equipment, services, and training. (Israel has also been allowed to use some of this aid to buy equipment from Israeli defense companies, but that domestic procurement will be phased out in the next few years, according to the Council on Foreign Relations .) If the Biden administration had wanted to suspend all aid to Israel, it could have called for that in a recent report. Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a report to Congress May 10 that said it was ""reasonable to assess"" that Israeli forces used weapons in Gaza that were ""inconsistent"" with international humanitarian law or best practices for avoiding civilian harm, but the report did not officially conclude that Israel violated law. The report was required under a National Security Memo signed by Biden in February. ""They were explicit in this report that Israel remains eligible for transfers,"" said Allison McManus, managing director for the national security and international policy department at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington. Our ruling Trump said, ""Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel."" That’s not what Biden said. In a CNN interview, Biden said his administration won’t supply the weapons for Israel to launch a full-scale attack on Rafah. Biden’s administration has paused sending Israel 3,500 bombs. But Biden clarified on CNN that he is not cutting Israel from all U.S. aid, a point his administration’s officials have echoed. Biden signed legislation in April that provides billions of dollars in supplemental aid to Israel on top of billions the U.S. already provides annually to Israel. Israel also continues to have access to the U.S. foreign military financing program. We rate this statement False. PolitiFact Senior Correspondent Louis Jacobson contributed to this fact-check. "
"May 14, 2024",Donald Trump,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called voter ID “racist,” calls NRA a “terrorist organization” and supports affirmative action.",half-true,"In 2008, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. co-authored a comic book that called voter identification ""racially rancid."" In a 2008 interview, he said a lot of Americans don’t have a driver’s license, including Black people. But the independent presidential candidate has talked about voter ID differently during his current campaign. After the 2018 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, Kennedy called the National Rifle Association a ""terror group."" However in 2023, he said on Fox News ""I don’t consider the NRA a terror group."" Kennedy made statements supporting affirmative action after a 2023 Supreme Court ruling striking down affirmative action in college admissions.","Amid independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s frequent appearances on conservative news, former President Donald Trump has taken notice. Trump, a Republican, said that a vote for Kennedy is a ""wasted protest vote"" and that the third-party candidate is ""far more LIBERAL than anyone running as a Democrat."" Trump was echoing the sentiment of radicalf-ingkennedy.com , a website of the MAGA Inc. political action committee. The Trump campaign made similar statements about Kennedy’s past positions in a May 2 post on X . ""RFK Jr. is a Radical Left Democrat,"" the Trump campaign account said. The campaign then said that Kennedy: Called Voter ID ""Racist"" Calls NRA a ""Terror Organization"" Supports Affirmative Action. The Trump campaign also pointed out Kennedy’s past support of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and ""praised"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator who ran for president as a Democrat. In July 2016, Kennedy endorsed Clinton’s presidential candidacy and called himself a ""huge admirer"" of Sanders , Clinton’s primary rival. Kennedy said in 2023 that he had no regrets about voting for former President Obama . Kennedy launched his presidential campaign in 2023 as a Democrat, but months later said he would run as an independent. He has taken some policy positions on the right and frequently gives interviews to conservative media . With Kennedy’s past embrace of Democratic leaders well documented. we wanted to explore the Trump campaign’s claims about his past positions. The statements about Kennedy’s positions on voter ID, the National Rifle Association and affirmative action missed some context. In 2008, Kennedy called voter ID racist Nearly two decades ago, Kennedy was critical of laws requiring voters to present ID. In an October 2008 interview with NBC host Rachel Maddow , Kennedy said voter ID was discriminatory. Kennedy said many Americans lack driver’s licenses, including older people, young people and Black people. ""In other words, Democratic voters,"" Kennedy said. ""One in 5 Democratic — 1 in 5 Black voters does not have a driver‘s license. That means if you require a driver‘s license, you‘re getting rid of 20% of the Black voters in this country."" Kennedy also joined journalist Greg Palast to co-author ""Steal Back Your Vote, "" a 2008 comic book that said nuns in Indiana were turned away from voting because their driver’s licenses were expired. The comic book referred to voter ID as a ""racially rancid rule."" The book mentioned research about the disproportionate impact on Black voters who were less likely to have a driver’s license than white people. In a 2021 article, PolitiFact highlighted similar research conclusions, including by academics and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution . States set their own laws for voter ID , including how strictly they are applied and what forms of ID, photo or others, are accepted. Today, the majority of states require some type of voter ID. The trend over the past two decades has been toward tighter voter ID requirements. But in his current presidential campaign, Kennedy has not called voter ID laws racist. Fox News’ Jesse Watters asked Kennedy on Aug. 29, 2023, about voter ID and how his plan would address concerns about fraud and ""illegal voting."" Kennedy replied that ""a lot of poor people, particularly people in cities who don't drive, don't have access to identification, and if we had voter ID laws, it would keep them from voting. So, it would keep a huge demographic of people from voting."" Kennedy said providing a free ID could solve this problem and did not describe voter ID laws as racist. In a May 1 interview with Watters , Kennedy walked back his earlier comments more completely. Watters: ""You said voter ID was racist. Is that true?"" Kennedy: ""Maybe. You know, look, I had a lot of positions. I went through an evolution like many people in this country. And you know, I said things years ago, I had positions years ago that I look back on and say that was not -— there was nothing good about that. I think we — you know, listen, what I've said on the voter ID issue is that I'm going to issue voter passports — passport IDs to every American who can't afford them, that will end that issue."" ""If free ID is made available, Mr. Kennedy is in favor of voter ID requirements to assure the public of election integrity,"" Stefanie Spear, a Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spokesperson, told PolitiFact. Kennedy called the NRA a ""terror group"" in 2018 In the aftermath of the Feb. 14, 2018, mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Kennedy described the NRA as terrorists. Kennedy tweeted Feb. 17, 2018 : ""Parkland students are right; the NRA is a terror group."" Two days earlier, Kennedy tweeted about Marjory Stoneman Douglas, using the abbreviation MSD: ""Let’s be honest. The NRA is as responsible for the MSD child murders as if they pulled the trigger. NRA has turned 2d Amendment into a suicide pact for our children. When do we deal with NRA?"" Kennedy deleted the post around May 2023, according to the Decensored News account . The Kennedy campaign did not answer our question about why. Kennedy walked back calling the NRA a ""terror group"" in an October 2023 interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. Hannity: ""Do you still believe the NRA is a terror group?"" Kennedy Jr.: ""I support the Second Amendment, like I do all the amendments of the Constitution, and I'm not going to take people's — "" Hannity: ""I didn’t ask you if you support the Second Amendment. You called in 2018, you said, 'Parkland students are right, the NRA is a terror group.' Do you believe that?"" Kennedy Jr. ""I don’t consider the NRA a terror group."" Hannity: ""Do you regret tweeting that in 2018?"" Kennedy Jr.: ""Well, I don’t recall tweeting it in 2018. But if I did, as I said, Sean, I don’t consider them a terror group and I support the Second Amendment."" Spear, Kennedy’s campaign spokesperson, said Kennedy ""has come to understand that the gun owners represented by the NRA have a legitimate viewpoint."" Kennedy spoke positively of affirmative action in 2023 In June 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court ended affirmative action for colleges. Kennedy tweeted on the day of the ruling: ""Regarding the Supreme Court banning affirmative action in higher ed(ucation) — I know many Americans feel that purely race-based decisions are unfair. However, this feeling misses important context. The effects of racist policies going back centuries are now self-perpetuating. Affirmative action understands this and uses race-based policies to undo the effects of racist policies. ‘Color-blind’ admissions tend to favor those who are already in the circle of privilege. It favors those who grew up in affluent, educated households. Wouldn’t you like to invite in those who have been left out in the cold?"" Asked about Kennedy’s position about affirmative action, Spear said, ""That tweet does not advocate affirmative action per se. It was intended to highlight the need to recognize the situation that affirmative action seeks to address. He believes we must find constitutionally sound and fair ways to address the legacy of centuries of racist practices that still affect the Black community."" When we asked Kennedy’s campaign for his current position on issues including affirmative action, Kennedy’s campaign sent us to the candidate’s policy portion of his website . The page about the Black community does not address affirmative action. That page of Kennedy’s website calls for ""increased trade school and college prep opportunities for our youth"" and said ""working on organic, healing farms will unlock significant assets to pay your way through college or learn a trade, start a small business or put a down payment on a home."" Our ruling A Trump campaign X post said Kennedy Jr. called voter ID ""racist,"" calls NRA a ""terrorist organization"" and supports affirmative action. The Trump campaign was careful and used the past tense ""called"" — a reference to Kennedy’s statements in 2008 in which he spoke about voter ID as racially discriminatory. But during his presidential campaign, Kennedy has talked about voter ID differently by stating that wants the government to provide free ID. In 2018, Kennedy called the NRA a ""terror group"" but in 2023 he said ""I don’t consider the NRA a terror group."" In 2023, he made statements in support of affirmative action. Overall, the Trump statement is partially accurate but is missing context, including about more recent statements that he made about voter ID and the NRA. We rate this statement Half True.

This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. As a quick online search shows, the notion that the two candidates are not campaigning is verifiably false. The Federal Election Commission shows the amount of money Biden, Trump and other official presidential candidates have raised and spent in the 2024 race. There’s also broad news coverage reflecting that these candidates are campaigning. In 2023, Biden and his allies spent more than $45 million in advertisements, a record amount for an incumbent in the off-year before the general election, NBC News reported . In March, Biden’s campaign launched a $30 million ad buy, Politico said , and announced the President, Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff would stump ""in every battleground state"" that month. C-SPAN has cataloged these televised rallies, most recently showing Harris campaigning in Pennsylvania while Biden was in Wisconsin . In May, Biden debuted ""a new-seven figure ad buy … centered around abortion, a centerpiece issue for his campaign,"" according to CBS News . The Trump campaign, meanwhile, announced with the Republican National Committee in March that the campaign had raised more than $65 million. Trump has likewise rallied in battleground states and coverage of these campaign events has been robust .""The former president's campaign events are surreal to experience,"" one NPR report said. ""All-day affairs that are equal parts religious revival and massive pep rallies, powered by an infamous musical playlist that runs for hours before he speaks."" Biden had ""a big edge"" in recent ad spending as ""Trump has had to devote millions of campaign funds to legal expenses,"" CNN said , but this does not corroborate the claim in the Facebook post.

""Tyrant can suspend presidential elections ‘IF’ a new pandemic hits the U.S.!"" the April 26 post says, sharing a screenshot of a blog post from the same date that says, in part, ""Biden issues Executive Order 14122."" But the blog post doesn’t suggest the executive order enables Biden to suspend elections. This Facebook post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Executive Order 14122 , issued April 12, does not empower Biden to suspend presidential elections. Rather, the order revokes several executive orders Biden’s administration deemed ""no longer necessary"" and transfers ""certain roles and responsibilities"" established by other executive orders to the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, which Congress established following the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the executive orders that Biden revoked: one ""preventing the hoarding of health and medical resources to respond to the spread of COVID-19"" and another ""requiring mask-wearing."" The order doesn’t mention suspending presidential elections. In fact, it doesn’t mention elections at all. U.S. law sets federal elections on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November during even-numbered years. As the Congressional Research Service notes , changing the date would require enacting a new law because ""neither the Constitution nor Congress provides any … power to the President or other federal officials to change this date outside of Congress’s regular legislative process.""

Este proceso se realiza con el Help America Vote Verification (HAVV, por sus siglas en inglés).

Todos los funcionarios electorales dijeron que toman medidas para garantizar que sólo los ciudadanos con derecho a votar emitan su voto y que no tienen pruebas de un registro generalizado de votantes no ciudadanos. ""Los datos no representan el número de nuevos votantes registrados, y cualquier representación que hagan es falsa"", dijo a PolitiFact Ellen Lyon, portavoz del Departamento de Estado de Pensilvania. Texas y Arizona exigen un documento de identidad con foto para votar, pero Pensilvania no. El departamento de prensa de la Administración del Seguro Social no respondió inmediatamente a nuestras preguntas sobre su data. Por ejemplo, en Pensilvania, según el Departamento de Estado, sólo ha habido 75,000 nuevos registros de votantes, lo que hace imposible que 580,513 votantes se registraran sin documento de identidad con foto, como afirma la publicación. ""En Pensilvania, el Departamento de Estado utiliza el Help America Vote Verification (HAVV) para comprobar parcialmente los números del Seguro Social no sólo para las solicitudes de registro de votantes, sino también para las solicitudes de voto en ausencia y por correo"", dijo Lyon. Los datos de la Administración del Seguro Social representan el número bruto de veces que un estado comprueba la verificación del Seguro Social de un votante. La base de datos tampoco muestra el número de no ciudadanos que se registraron este año, sin un documento de identidad con foto. Tampoco verifica su estatus de ciudadanía. En Texas, sólo 57,711 nuevos votantes se han registrado este año, según la Secretaria de Estado Jane Nelson, exsenadora republicana. Su oficina emitió un comunicado en el que calificaba la cifra de 1.2 millones publicada en redes sociales como ""claramente incorrecta."" ""Cuando los tejanos se registran para votar deben proporcionar el número de su licencia de conducir o el número del Seguro Social. Cuando una persona se registra para votar sólo con un SSN, el estado verifica que el SSN es auténtico"", explicó el comunicado. Arizona ha tomado medidas similares para contrarrestar las afirmaciones inexactas en redes sociales. Stephen Richer, registrador republicano del condado de Maricopa en Arizona, dijo en X que en Arizona sólo ha habido alrededor de 60,000 nuevos registros de votantes este año y las verificaciones del Seguro Social se utilizan para comprobar la prueba de identidad, no para comprobar el estatus de ciudadanía. JP Martin, portavoz del secretario de estado de Arizona, dijo a PolitiFact que el 90% de la verificación de la prueba de ciudadanía se realiza a través del Departamento de Vehículos de Motor en Arizona, no a través de la Administración del Seguro Social. En un caso de votación en Arizona , la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos dictaminó en 2013 que los estados están obligados a permitir el registro para las elecciones federales utilizando un formulario federal que no requiere prueba documental de ciudadanía. Eso significa que Arizona proporciona a los votantes que carecen de pruebas, una boleta ""solo federal"". El estado tiene alrededor de 35,000 personas en la lista federal de los aproximadamente 4 millones de votantes , dijo Martin. Ese número es casi ocho veces menor que la cantidad de consultas de la HAVV que se hicieron para verificar los números del Seguro Social de los votantes. Un artículo de Votebeat Arizona descubrió que la mayoría de los votantes federales en Arizona, son estudiantes universitarios que no pueden acceder fácilmente a documentos que prueben su ciudadanía. En medio de un elevado número de encuentros fronterizos este año, las cuentas virales de las redes sociales y algunos políticos, incluido el expresidente Donald Trump, han seguido difundiendo la falsedad del voto masivo de los no ciudadanos. Los no ciudadanos votan en alguna ocasión, pero es raro. La mayoría de los no ciudadanos no quieren arriesgarse a ir a la cárcel (o a ser deportados si están aquí ilegalmente) por votar. Los funcionarios electorales toman varias medidas para asegurarse de que sólo votan los que cumplen los requisitos. Nuestro veredicto Una publicación en Facebook afirma que los datos de la Administración del Seguro Social prueban que más de 2 millones de no ciudadanos se registraron para votar sin identificación con foto en Arizona, Pensilvania y Texas este año. Pero los datos no reflejan el número de no ciudadanos que se han registrado para votar sin una identificación con foto. Los datos muestran la cantidad de veces que los estados han verificado los números del Seguro Social de los votantes. Los estados pueden solicitar la verificación del número del Seguro Social de un mismo votante varias veces.

Regal Cinemas said in 2023 it would close about three dozen movie theaters. Gap Inc. announced its store closures in 2020, when Donald Trump was president. Macy’s Inc. announced store closures during both Trump’s and Biden’s presidencies. Foot Locker announced mall store closures, but plans to open almost as many stand-alone stores. Dollar Tree and Burger King announced plans to close 1,000 stores and 400 stores, respectively.","Some social media users are claiming that a number of businesses have reported hundreds of store closures under Joe Biden’s presidency. An April 19 Facebook post shared a photo of eight retail, fast food, entertainment and grocery stores with their purported number of closures: ""Dollar Tree: 1,000 stores closing. Walgreens: 900 stores closing. Macy’s: 150 stores closing. Foot Locker: 400 stores closing. Gap: 350 stores closing. Burger King: 400 stores closing. Regal Cinemas: 429 locations closing. Kroger: 413 stores closing."" Text on the photo read, ""Is this building back better?"" referring to Biden’s 2020 campaign slogan and presidential agenda , Build Back Better. The post also criticized ""Bidenomics."" (Screengrab from Facebook) This post and others like it were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Some of these figures lack context; others are incorrect. Here’s a breakdown of how many of these eight businesses’ stores have closed during Biden’s presidency. These closures are largely because of lower sales or business rebrands; none cited Biden’s policies as the reason for the closures. ""Dollar Tree: 1,000 stores closing"" This is largely accurate. Dollar Tree acquired Family Dollar in 2015 for $8 billion, and plans to close hundreds of Family Dollar stores. In March, Dollar Tree said it plans to close about 600 Family Dollar stores across the U.S. in this year’s first half, The Associated Press reported . Over the next several years, Dollar Tree plans to close another 370 Family Dollar stores and 30 Dollar Tree locations. ""Walgreens: 900 stores closing"" This is inaccurate. This number refers to the number of recent store closings for CVS, not Walgreens. Walgreens said in June 2023 that it plans to close 150 U.S. locations by August 2024, CNN reported . In 2019, when Donald Trump was president, Walgreens said it was closing 200 stores in the U.S. CVS said in November 2021 that it planned to close 900 stores by 2024. Shoppers enter a Macy's department store in Bay Shore, Long Island, New York, Dec. 12, 2023. (AP) ""Macy’s: 150 stores closing"" This number is correct, but needs context. Macy’s Inc. said in February that it planned to close 150 ""underproductive"" stores in the U.S. through 2026. Fifty of these stores will close by Dec. 31. In February 2020, when Trump was in office, Macy’s announced 125 store closings, the AP reported . ""Foot Locker: 400 stores closing"" This is missing context. Foot Locker said in March 2023 that it plans to close 400 stores in ""underperforming"" malls across North America by 2026, CBS News reported . However, the company also said it will open about 300 free-standing locations focused on its ""Community,"" ""Power"" and ""House of Play"" store concepts. The company said these decisions are part of its ""Lace Up"" strategic plan to ""reset"" its business and increase revenue to $9.5 billion by 2026. ""Gap: 350 stores closing"" This number is accurate, but the closures weren’t announced on Biden’s watch. Gap said in October 2020, when Trump was president, that it would close 350 stores, including 220 of its namesake Gap stores and 130 Banana Republic stores, in North America (not just the U.S.) by 2024, CBS News reported . Gap’s website lists all of the completed store closures since 2020; it says 189 Gap stores and 134 Banana Republic stores have closed. A ""Home of the Whopper"" sign welcomes customers outside the Burger King fast food restaurant, on Feb. 1, 2021, in Epping, N.H. (AP) ""Burger King: 400 stores closing"" This figure is largely accurate. Joshua Kobza, CEO of Restaurant Brands International Inc., which owns Burger King, said in May 2023 that the company planned to close 300 to 400 U.S. locations by the end of 2023. Kobza said the company typically closes ""a couple (of) hundred"" Burger King locations each year, Restaurant Dive reported . When contacted by PolitiFact, a Burger King spokesperson provided no details about the chain’s exact number of closures in 2023. ""Regal Cinemas: 429 stores closing"" We found no reports that this many Regal Cinemas movie theaters were closing. Cineworld, the company that owns Regal Cinemas, said in January 2023 that it was planning to reject leases for 39 U.S. movie theaters. This announcement came a few months after Cineworld filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, CNN reported. (Chapter 11 bankruptcy lets companies keep operating as they reorganize their assets and debts.) In September 2022, Regal Cinemas closed 12 locations. It’s unclear how many Regal Cinemas locations closed after January 2023. We contacted Regal Cinemas, but received no response. The company’s website says it has 426 theaters in the U.S. ""Kroger: 413 stores closing"" This is wrong. Kroger has not announced store closures. To clear a path for a merger, announced in 2022, grocery store chains Kroger and Albertsons said in 2023 they were selling 413 stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers for $1.9 billion, the AP reported . But the federal government sued to block the merger in February, saying the merger would lead to a less competitive market and higher prices for consumers. On April 22, Kroger and Albertsons said they would sell an additional 166 stores to appease the government’s concerns, the AP reported . Erin Rolfes, a Kroger spokesperson, told PolitiFact that Kroger will not close any stores as a result of the merger. ""Stores divested to C&S are not stores that will be closed — they are stores that will be run in the same manner they are today, just by C&S instead of Kroger or Albertsons,"" Rolfes said. Our ruling A Facebook post claimed there have been mass closures across several businesses during Biden’s presidency. Some information in the post lacked context, including that some closing announcements preceded Biden’s presidency and that some businesses were opening new stores. The post also shared inaccurate information about the number of stores closing for three businesses. Although some information in the post is accurate, the claim omits important details. We rate this claim Half True. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report. "
"April 19, 2024",Donald Trump,"“This trial that I have now, that’s a Biden trial.”",false,"The Manhattan district attorney’s investigation into Trump’s business records began before Joe Biden was president. By the time Trump was charged in 2023, Biden was president. The investigation took many twists and turns, but Trump’s fighting the subpoena of his business records lengthened the timeline. District Attorney Alvin Bragg hired a former Justice Department prosecutor in 2022. But experts told us that doesn’t prove Biden was involved.","Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg brought the charges against former President Donald Trump over falsifying business records to pay off adult film actor Stormy Daniels. But Trump says President Joe Biden is really the person behind the case. Trump has made the claim many times in many places. ""This trial that I have now, that’s a Biden trial,"" Trump said April 16 in front of a New York City bodega on the second day of jury selection. ""Two days from now, the entire world will witness the commencement of the very first Biden trial,"" he said at an April 13 rally in Pennsylvania. ""As you witness this Biden trial, I ask all Americans to remember that this is not just about me, this is about our country and this is about you,"" Trump said in an April 15 video . These statements are wrong. There is no evidence that Biden orchestrated the charges against Trump. Bragg said in April 2023 that Trump was charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment to Daniels made through Trump’s then-attorney Michael Cohen. (Daniels’ real name is Stephanie Clifford.) ""Alvin Bragg is an independently elected state prosecutor who has nothing to do with Biden, the (Justice Department) or the federal government,"" said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a criminal defense attorney who worked at the Manhattan district attorney’s office before Bragg took over. ""In fact, if Trump were convicted, even if he wanted to, Biden could not pardon him. It is wholly and entirely separate in every way."" We contacted a Trump campaign spokesperson for this fact-check and received no reply. Manhattan investigation into Trump began before Biden was president The investigation into Trump’s business records is based on New York state law. The Justice Department prosecutes only federal crimes in federal courts and cannot control state prosecutions, said Frank O. Bowman III , a University of Missouri law professor and former local prosecutor in Denver and federal prosecutor in Florida. ""Local district attorneys prosecute state criminal violations in state criminal courts,"" Bowman said. ""They are not under the control of the U.S. Department of Justice. Moreover, in my experience, they are fiercely independent and would resent any effort from the U.S. Justice Department to interfere in their decision-making."" The Manhattan investigation into Trump began in 2018, before Biden was president. It faced many twists, turns and delays amid the coronavirus pandemic, 2020 presidential election and lead prosecutors quitting. After Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges in 2018, then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. opened an investigation into the payments, Politico reported . Federal prosecutors could not charge Trump then because of the Justice Department’s policy not to bring criminal charges against a sitting president, Politico reported . After federal prosecutors concluded their investigation, Vance in August 2019 subpoenaed Trump’s personal and corporate tax records. Trump’s lawyers fought the subpoena, and the U.S. Supreme Court in July 2020 ruled in Vance’s favor. By the time Vance obtained the records, it was February 2021, early in Biden’s presidency. Bragg was elected to replace Vance and took office in 2022. Any cooperation between federal and local prosecutors generally is voluntary, said Melissa Redmon, a former local prosecutor in Georgia and University of Georgia law professor. When Bragg sought federal records about Cohen’s telephone, federal prosecutors declined, saying ""it would be unduly burdensome."" Trump’s attorneys subpoenaed records from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. ""We would have seen much more early information sharing if the offices were acting in concert,"" Redmon said. Although Trump was implicated in Cohen’s case, federal prosecutors in New York never charged him. Bragg hired former DOJ attorney, but that doesn’t prove Biden involvement In earlier versions of this statement, Trump highlighted a Biden link in one of the attorneys Bragg hired to work the case. One of Bragg’s prosecutors, Matthew Colangelo, worked for the U.S. Justice Department and the New York attorney general’s office before Bragg said he would join the district attorney’s office in December 2022. In March, Trump called Colangelo a ""radical left"" prosecutor who was ""put into the district attorney's office to run the trial against Trump."" In his two years at the Justice Department, Colangelo helped oversee the antitrust, civil, civil rights, environment and natural resources, and tax divisions. Colangelo served as acting associate attorney general, the department’s third-highest-ranking position, during the Biden administration’s first few months, until Vanita Gupta was confirmed. Colangelo then served as the principal deputy associate attorney general. Colangelo also served in the Obama administration . When Colangelo worked for the New York attorney general, he investigated the Trump Foundation and led lawsuits against the Trump administration. The New York Times reported that Bragg and Colangelo overlapped at the attorney general’s office. But Colangelo’s presence on Bragg’s team doesn’t prove that Biden, or officials in his White House or campaign, were involved in the case. Multiple lawyers told us it’s unsurprising that Bragg would hire Colangelo, a longtime prosecutor with experience investigating Trump. Prosecutors commonly move between jobs at federal, state and high-profile local offices. ""The more relevant prior position held by Colangelo is not his DOJ jobs, but the NY AG position in which he participated in the Trump Foundation investigation,"" Bowman said. ""I'd bet that Bragg hired him in part because of his familiarity with the intricacies of Trump's businesses and financial dealings. But, again, that proves exactly nothing about Biden influence on the Manhattan case."" Bill Otis, former head of the Appellate Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia and a former special counsel to former President George H.W. Bush, raised questions about Bragg hiring Colangelo. ""There are about a zillion smart lawyers on the East Coast,"" he said. ""Why does Alvin Bragg need to use one with high-level links to Biden's DOJ?"" Nevertheless, Trump is exaggerating, Otis said. Bragg hiring Colangelo ""does not prove Biden's personal involvement in investigating and/or charging Trump, but it's another smelly straw in the wind."" Our ruling Trump said that ""this trial that I have now that’s a Biden trial."" The Manhattan district attorney’s investigation of Trump began in 2018, before Biden was his party’s presidential nominee. Bragg filed the charges in 2023. Trump’s fighting a subpoena lengthened this timeline. Trump has criticized that Bragg hired Colangelo, a former Justice Department prosecutor who investigated Trump when he worked for the New York attorney general. It’s not uncommon for seasoned prosecutors to move among federal, state and local offices. Reasonable people may question the political wisdom of Bragg’s hire, but it doesn’t prove that Biden has directed the Manhattan investigation. We rate Trump’s statement False.

""We ALL saw it… 2020 was stolen!,"" the post’s caption said. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. This claim is inaccurate. Biden was certified as the winner of Pennsylvania and several courts (including the U.S. Supreme Court ) have rejected attempts to challenge the state’s election result. Biden won the state by more than 80,000 votes . Pennsylvania has the fifth largest number of electoral college votes , and voters there have flipped between Democratic and Republican candidates, making it a crucial state for presidential candidates. In the hours and days after polls close, television stations rely on partners to supply them with information about vote counts. Sometimes human error means that information is inaccurate. Results also change as more votes are counted after Election Day. In the case of the 2020 presidential election, Pennsylvania had a high number of mail-in ballots. Most of the mail-in ballots went to Biden , propelling him to victory in that state. PolitiFact has previously debunked similar claims that attempt to use television news coverage as evidence of electoral fraud. Such claims were made in the 2022 Georgia Senate runoff and in the 2021 California governor recall election .

States can also repeatedly run verification requests on the same person’s Social Security number. ​Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy. Learn more.,"A social media user took to Facebook to spread the word about what he claims is documented evidence of voter fraud. ""Show your Democrat friend this post when they claim voter fraud doesn’t occur,"" read the April 2 Facebook post . ""From the Federal Social Security website (link below), you can see how many people each of the 43 states are registering to vote who DO NOT HAVE IDs."" The post included a screengrab of a spreadsheet and a link to a Social Security Administration webpage. This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Screenshot from Facebook.) The linked page showed the Social Security Administration’s ""Weekly Data for Help America Vote Verification (HAVV) Transactions by State January 2011 to Present Totals."" However, this data wasn’t what the post promised. Rather than showing how many people have registered to vote without IDs, the table’s data reflects the number of times a state requested information from a Social Security Administration system used to verify voters’ identities. The Help America Vote Verification System Under the 2002 Help America Vote Act , state election officials must verify new voters’ information. States can do this by verifying a voter’s driver’s license number against the state’s Motor Vehicle Administration’s database or, in cases in which the voter does has no driver’s license, verifying the last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number. In response to the 2002 law, the Social Security Administration set up the Help America Vote Verification system, sometimes called the HAVV system . Today, the Social Security Administration reports that 43 states use this system to verify a person’s name, birth date and last four Social Security number digits. The table the post linked to tracks states’ requests for four-digit matches from January 2011 on. It shows how many have been processed, how many could not be processed, how many yielded matches and how many weren’t matched. The data does not reflect numbers of people, let alone people registered to vote. Sean Morales-Doyle, who directs the voting rights program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, said it is inaccurate to claim the table shows how many people states have registered to vote without IDs. ""The fact that a state is verifying the last four digits of a registrant’s Social Security number does not mean that that person registered to vote without an ID,"" he said. Federal law requires that people registering to vote in a federal election provide a driver’s license number, a state ID number, the last four digits of a Social Security number or check a box saying they have none of those things, Morales-Doyle said. New York State’s voter registration form. (Screenshot from New York State Board of Elections) On some states’ voter registration forms, voters who have IDs and Social Security numbers could simply choose to fill in the Social Security number because it’s a number they have memorized, he said. Filling out that section of the application does not in itself mean the applicants lack IDs. States can also repeatedly request verifications on the same person’s Social Security number. In a 2010 audit of the Social Security Administration system, the inspector general’s office found that during fiscal year 2008, 32% of transactions submitted by 25 states ""related to the same voter data being re-submitted 10 or more times."" Ohio, for example, ""submitted the same voter information 1,778 times during the year for a 77-year-old man who died in December 2005,"" the audit found. The Social Security Administration’s press office did not immediately respond to our questions about the data. Officials in multiple states rebut this claim Responding to claims misrepresenting the Social Security Administration’s data, election officials in Arizona, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin said that the data does not show millions of people registering to vote without IDs. Although the system was developed to verify identities when people lack driver’s license numbers, Morales-Doyle said, ""That doesn’t actually mean that every time someone is being run through this system it’s because they just registered and they don’t have a driver’s license number."" The data contains no specific information about whether the people registering had photo IDs. ""In Pennsylvania, the Department of State uses the Help America Vote Verification (HAVV) to check partial social security numbers (SSN) not only for voter registration applications, but also for absentee and mail ballot applications,"" Pennsylvania Department of State spokesperson Ellen Lyon told PolitiFact . Robert Kehoe, a Wisconsin Elections Commission deputy administrator, said that the state’s data as it appears on the Social Security Administration’s website reflects that a voter registered without providing a state ID or driver’s license number. Wisconsin voter registrations are verified using Wisconsin Department of Transportation data or, if an ID number is unavailable, using Social Security number verification. JP Martin, a spokesperson for Arizona’s secretary of state, told PolitiFact that 90% of verification of citizenship proof is done through the Motor Vehicles Division in Arizona, not through the Social Security Administration. This isn’t the first time this data has been used to amplify unsupported claims of supposed voter fraud by noncitizens. We’ve similar statements from conservative internet influencers, former President Donald Trump and X owner Elon Musk and rated them False . Fraudulent voter registration and voting by noncitizens is rare and usually happens because of a misunderstanding or a mistake. (Voting by noncitizens carries high risks that include deportation or incarceration.) Nevertheless, politicians including Trump and his allies have continuously spread false claims about rampant fraudulent voting by noncitizens. Not all people without IDs are noncitizens. One 2023 survey found that almost 21 million voting-age U.S. citizens do not have valid, unexpired driver’s licenses. And, someone registering to vote does not mean a vote was cast, said Cassondra Knudson, a spokesperson for Minnesota’s Secretary of State. Election officials have several layers of verification to ensure only eligible voters cast ballots. Our ruling A social media post claimed data on the Social Security Administration’s website showed ""how many people each of the 43 states are registering to vote who DO NOT HAVE IDs."" That’s inaccurate: It shows the results of requests from 43 states to verify partial Social Security numbers under the Help America Vote Act. Sometimes states verify the same voter’s information multiple times, and not all verification requests are for voters registering without IDs. We rate this claim False.

"April 8, 2024",Jonathan Becker,"After a 2022 law, “the vast majority of colleges in New York State do not have on-campus poll sites.”",mostly-true,"Two studies, one of them by Jonathan Becker's group, support the idea that a little under two-thirds of four-year New York State colleges lack a campus voting site. The difficulty of obtaining information makes it unclear how many of the campuses studied would be covered by a 2022 law requiring campus voting sites. Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy. Learn more .","Legislation enacted by New York state in 2022 requires most colleges and universities in the state to establish voting sites on or near campus. But a Bard College official who tracks the issue recently warned university presidents that little progress had been made on turning this mandate into reality. In a February open letter to New York state’s college presidents, Jonathan Becker, vice president for academic affairs at Bard College and director of the Hudson Valley college’s Center for Civic Engagement, urged colleges to create polling locations on or near campus if they don’t exist already. ""Unfortunately, as two recent studies show, state and local election administrators have not adequately prioritized or fully implemented this critical voter protection legislation,"" Becker wrote. ""The vast majority of colleges in New York state do not have on-campus poll sites and there has been almost no change since the passage of this legislation."" The two studies Becker cited show many college campuses in New York state lack voting sites. There’s statistical uncertainty about how many of these campuses would be covered by the law’s voting site requirements. What the 2022 legislation required Becker and other campus voting experts have long complained that boards of election, in New York state and elsewhere, have often imposed strict residency requirements and made voting sites inaccessible. Bard — along with the Andrew Goodman Foundation, a New York City-based voting rights group named for one of the three voter-registration volunteers murdered in Mississippi in 1964 — has been involved in the issue for years, filing lawsuits in 2020 and 2021 to bring a polling place to campus . ""I think a lot of students don't know that they can register to vote at their campus address,"" said Caroline Smith, the Andrew Goodman Foundation’s programs director. ""I think this is a major reason why students tend to vote absentee"" in their home state rather than where they attend school. The lawsuits prompted the inclusion of a provision in New York state’s 2023 budget that required colleges and universities with more than 300 registered voters on campus to have an on-campus polling location or one near the campus that was approved in coordination with the university. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed the budgetary legislation that included the provision in April 2022. Becker told PolitiFact that both students and faculty members living on campus count toward the 300-voter threshold. The legislation also prevented campuses from being divided into multiple voting districts. How much progress has been made? Becker cited two studies showing that progress on applying the law has been incomplete. One study , published in February 2024 by Becker’s Center for Civic Engagement, found that almost half of New York’s 41 four-year public institutions with more than 1,000 students had regular or early voting sites. Twenty public universities had a polling location, and 21 did not. Four-year public institutions with on-campus polling sites included Binghamton University, Brooklyn College, Stony Brook University and University at Albany. Those that did not included the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and the University at Buffalo. The rate of on-campus voting sites was lower for the 64 private institutions with more than 600 undergraduates, at 22%. Sixteen private universities had a polling location; 48 did not. Private institutions with on-campus polling sites included Bard, Cornell University, New York University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Skidmore College, Syracuse University, Vassar College and Yeshiva University. Private institutions that did not have an on-campus site included Barnard College, Colgate University, Columbia College, Fordham University, Hamilton College, Hofstra University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Sarah Lawrence College, St. Bonaventure University, St. John’s University and the University of Rochester. A team from Rutgers Law School led by Yael Bromberg, a professor there, conducted the other study, which found a ""minor increase (2.2%) in the presence of on-campus poll sites between the 2018 and 2022 elections, when the law came into effect."" The study cautioned that some information was difficult to secure. Many boards of elections ""do not have information on poll site locations on their websites, and those that do often do not indicate if the poll sites are on a college campus,"" the study said. ""Calls to boards of election often went unanswered. When interviewers did speak to board representatives and requested basic public information, such as whether a poll site is situated on a college campus, answers were often withheld until a Freedom of Information Act request was filed. Even then, Freedom of Information Act requests often went unanswered."" However, the study was able to use two other methods to determine whether campuses had a voting site: a survey of college administrators and cross-checking poll site addresses provided by boards of election. As a result, Becker said the study provides solid math on whether a college has a campus voting site. Another factor, however, involves some uncertainty. The researchers often couldn’t confirm the number of registered voters on campus. So, they used a workaround to make an estimate: They looked at colleges with 1,000 students and assumed that it was plausible that 300 of them could be registered voters who lived on campus. ""We're listing places which could meet the requirements,"" Becker said. ""We have no idea; that's part of the whole story."" So while the study supports the notion that 36 four-year campuses had voting sites and 69 did not, or just under two-thirds, it is unable to say with certainty how many of these institutions have the minimum 300 registered voters on campus to trigger the law’s requirements. That’s an important distinction within the context of a letter designed to encourage adherence to the 2022 law. The Andrew Goodman Foundation’s Smith said such obstacles demand action from college presidents. ""Administrations will often focus on what’s being brought to their attention,"" said Smith. ""I think securing on-campus polling sites requires the active support and leadership of campus administration."" Our ruling Becker said ""the vast majority of colleges in New York State do not have on-campus poll sites."" Two studies, one of them by his own group, support the idea that a little under two-thirds of four-year New York State colleges lack a campus voting site. However, the difficulty of obtaining information about registered voters on campus makes it unclear how many of the campuses studied would be covered by the law. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True. CORRECTION NOTE, April 9 and 10, 2024 : After publication, we updated this story. We first corrected our reporting to show that statistical uncertainties in the Bard study pertain to whether campuses are covered by the on-campus voting site law from 2022, not to whether the school has an on-campus voting site. We updated the rating of this fact-check from Half True to Mostly True. On April 10, we clarified more language in our fact-check about our rating scope and corrected a reference to a study's findings on election boards' websites. "

A March 19 TikTok video showed still images of Alina Habba, an attorney representing Trump, and Arthur Engoron, the New York Supreme Court justice presiding over Trump’s civil business fraud case. Text above the images read, ""Awake yet? Donald Trump’s attorney, Alina Habba, just exposed Judge Arthur Engoron on her Telegram! He took a $10,000,000 BRIBE from Joe Biden’s shell companies to convict Donald Trump!"" TikTok identified this video as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok .) (Screengrab from TikTok) This claim was also reshared multiple times on X. In February, Engoron ruled that Trump and the Trump Organization must pay $454 million for fraudulently inflating Trump’s net worth. An appeals court lowered the bond to $175 million and Trump posted a bond in that amount April 1. New York Attorney General Letitia James has questioned the validity of Trump’s bond; Engoron scheduled a hearing April 22 to discuss it. Although Habba has criticized Engoron’s ruling, there is no evidence she’s accused the judge of taking a bribe from Biden. Erica Knight, Habba’s spokesperson, told PolitiFact Habba made no such assertion. We also found no posts on Habba’s social media accounts or credible news coverage of her supposed bribery accusation. We searched ""Alina Habba"" on Telegram and found at least 10 accounts — some with thousands of followers — using her name and likeness. None of these accounts are authentic because Habba doesn’t have a Telegram account, her spokesperson said. (Screengrabs from Telegram) The social media posts also wrongly claim that Engoron convicted Trump. Civil court cases , such as the one Trump lost in New York, can involve disputes about money and debts, property, injuries, marriage or children. Civil cases result in monetary damages or court orders, not convictions , which occur when people are found guilty in criminal cases. We rate the claim that Habba said on Telegram that Engoron took a ""$10 million bribe from Joe Biden’s shell companies to convict Donald Trump"" False. "
"April 5, 2024",Instagram posts,"More than 2 million people registered to vote so far this year without photo ID in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Texas.",false,"Data collected by the Social Security Administration does not show the number of noncitizens who registered to vote without photo identification this year. The data shows how many times state officials verified partial Social Security numbers for voter registration applications, mail ballots and absentee ballots, Ellen Lyon, a Pennsylvania's Department of State spokesperson said. The same voter’s Social Security number could be verified multiple times in one year.

Learn more about PolitiFact’s fact-checking process and rating system.","Former President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Republican influencers all amplified a false claim on social media that suggests 2 million noncitizens have registered to vote without photo ID in three swing states this year. An Instagram post included screenshots of X posts from DC_Draino and End Wokeness, two popular social media accounts that we have previously fact - checked . ""Over 8 million illegal aliens have invaded America under Biden,"" the screenshot of the DC_Draino X image read. ""Now we learn more than 2 million voter registrations have been completed *WITHOUT VOTER ID* in the past 3 months in 3 crucial states for 2024. Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Now you know why the border is open."" The post’s second slide contains a screenshot from End Wokeness that Elon Musk reshared on X with the text ""extremely concerning."" Musk has repeatedly shared voting and immigration misinformation on the platform he owns. The End Wokeness post claimed, ""The number of voters registering without a photo ID is SKYROCKETING in 3 key swing states: Arizona, Texas, and Pennsylvania. Since the start of 2024: TX: 1,250,710 PA: 580,513 AZ: 220,731."" These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. We saw similar statements on X , TikTok and Facebook . On Truth Social , former President Donald Trump asked who are the millions of voters registering without photo ID. The figures in the social posts represent the number of times states have verified voters’ Social Security numbers. This process is done with the Help America Vote Verification (HAVV). HAVV is a system established in 2004 in which states can verify a voter’s identification with the Social Security Administration. State or local election officials in the three states — including Republicans — said the figures do not accurately reflect the number of voters’ who registered without photo ID. All of the election officials said they take steps to ensure that only eligible citizens cast ballots and had no evidence of widespread voter registration by noncitizens. ""The data does not represent the numbers of newly registered voters, and any representation they do is false,"" Ellen Lyon, a spokesperson at Pennsylvania’s Department of State, told PolitiFact. We told the End Wokeness social media user that voting officials from the three states said the data was misrepresented in the social post. The account’s author responded by saying ""it is deeply concerning that ANYONE is registering to vote without a photo ID"" and criticized mail-in voting. Texas and Arizona require a photo ID to vote, but Pennsylvania does not. The Social Security Administration’s press office did not immediately respond to our questions about the data. States also use the system to verify new voters who do not use a photo ID when registering to vote. As a result, the same voter’s Social Security number could be verified multiple times in one year. For example, in Pennsylvania, according to the Department of State, there have been only 75,000 new voter registrations, making it impossible that 580,513 voters registered without photo ID as the claim asserts. ""In Pennsylvania, the Department of State uses the Help America Vote Verification (HAVV) to check partial social security numbers (SSN) not only for voter registration applications, but also for absentee and mail ballot applications,"" Lyon said. The Social Security Administration’s data represents the raw number of times a state checks a voter’s social security verification. The database also does not show the number of noncitizens who registered this year without a photo ID. Nor does it verify their citizenship status. In Texas, only 57,711 new voters have registered this year, according to Secretary of State Jane Nelson, a former Republican state senator. Her office released a statement earlier this month calling the 1.2 million figure in social media posts ""clearly incorrect."" ""When Texans register to vote they must provide a driver license number or a Social Security number. When an individual registers to vote with just a SSN, the state verifies that the SSN is authentic,"" the statement explained. Arizona has taken similar steps to counter the inaccurate social media claims. Stephen Richer, Arizona’s Republican Maricopa County Recorder, replied to Musk’s post on X, explaining how the claim is inaccurate. ""There is 0 validity to the suggestion in the original post that 220,731 illegal immigrants have registered in Arizona in 2024,"" Richer wrote. Richer said that in Arizona there have been only about 60,000 new voter registrations this year and Social Security verifications are used to check proof of identity, not to check citizenship status. Screenshot from X JP Martin, a spokesperson for Arizona’s secretary of state, told PolitiFact that 90% of verification of citizenship proof is done through the Motor Vehicles Division in Arizona, not through the Social Security Administration. In an Arizona voting case , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that states are obligated to permit registration for federal elections using a federal form that does not require documentary proof of citizenship. That means that Arizona provides voters who lack proof with a ""federal only"" ballot. The state has about 35,000 people on the federal-only list out of the roughly 4 million voters, Martin said. That number is nearly eight times smaller than the amount of HAVV queries that were made to verify voter’s Social Security numbers. An article by Votebeat Arizona found that the majority of federal-only voters in Arizona are college-age students who may not be able to easily access documents that prove their citizenship. Amid a high number of border encounters this year, viral social media accounts and some politicians including Trump have continued to spread the long-standing falsehood of mass voting by noncitizens. Noncitizens occasionally cast ballots , but this is rare. Most noncitizens don’t want to risk jail time (or deportation if they are here illegally) by casting a ballot. Election officials take several steps to ensure that only eligible voters cast ballots. Our ruling An Instagram post claims that the Social Security Administration’s data proves that more than 2 million noncitizens registered to vote without photo ID in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Texas this year. But the data does not reflect the number of noncitizens who have registered to vote without a photo ID. The data shows the amount of times states have verified voters’ Social Security numbers. States can request to verify the same voter’s Social Security number multiple times. State officials from Arizona, Pennsylvania and Texas said the numbers of people who registered to vote this year in their respective states are significantly smaller than the figures cited in the post. We rate this claim False. PolitiFact Senior Correspondent Amy Sherman contributed to this report. "
"April 5, 2024",Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,"“President Biden is the first candidate in history, the first president in history, that has used the federal agencies to censor political speech ... to censor his opponent.""",false,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread vaccine misinformation, sued the Biden administration, arguing that the government sought to have tech companies suppress First Amendment-protected speech. Two states separately sued the administration over its communications with social media companies. Presidents John Adams and Woodrow Wilson signed sedition laws that targeted critics of the federal government, prompting some of those critics to be prosecuted and punished. Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy. Learn more.","Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused President Joe Biden of being a greater ""threat to democracy"" than former President Donald Trump, arguing that Biden censored him. ""President Biden is the first candidate in history, the first president in history that has used the federal agencies to censor political speech or to censor his opponent,"" Kennedy said in an April 1 interview on CNN. Kennedy, who is running as an independent, referred to his lawsuit against the federal government in which he alleges the government censored his social media statements against vaccines. A judge granted Kennedy’s request for a preliminary injunction in the case, although it was stayed pending a ruling in another case. Biden, Kennedy said on CNN, ""started censoring — not just me — but 37 hours after he took the oath of office, he was censoring me. No president in the country has ever done that."" Kennedy then pivoted to a lawsuit two Republican-led states filed to challenge the federal government’s communications with social media companies. ""The greatest threat to democracy is not somebody who questions election returns, but a president of the United States who uses the power of his office to force the social media companies … to censor his political critics,"" he said. There are a few problems with Kennedy’s statement. First, he wasn’t Biden’s political opponent in January 2021, when a Biden administration official noticed Kennedy posting an anti-vaccine conspiracy theory and contacted Twitter. Kennedy didn’t declare his presidential run until April 2023. Second, history shows there have been other U.S. presidents who have taken far more extreme measures to silence political dissent. Third, the court cases that Kennedy alluded to remain pending; Kennedy can continue to freely make statements about vaccines. Experts told PolitiFact that the Biden administration’s efforts to get social media platforms to moderate false posts is not the same as censoring opponents. We emailed the Kennedy campaign press team and received a response that our request for comment was under consideration. Biden White House sought removal of COVID-19 misinformation Kennedy wrote Jan. 22, 2021, on Twitter, that U.S. Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron died as ""part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly"" following his COVID-19 vaccine. Aaron , 86, died from unrelated natural causes, a medical examiner found. A Biden White House official emailed Twitter Jan. 23, 2021, and said, ""Wondering if we can get moving on the process for having it removed ASAP."" At the time, social media companies including Twitter policies had developed policies to handle false or misleading claims about COVID-19. Kennedy’s post wasn’t removed; it is still live today. Instagram’s parent company disabled Kennedy’s personal Instagram account in February 2021 for spreading false claims about COVID-19 and vaccines, but restored it after he launched his presidential bid more than two years later. His Instagram account has nearly 2 million followers. Courts weighing censorship question Kennedy, along with his legal advocacy group Children’s Health Defense and a Louisiana resident sued the administration in 2023, arguing that the government worked to have tech companies suppress First Amendment-protected speech, including items that could make the public ""hesitant"" toward COVID-19 vaccine mandates. The lawsuit states that a Biden spokesperson accused Kennedy of ""producing 65% of anti-vaccine misinformation on social-media platforms."" The lawsuit is not only about COVID-19 posts or posts by Kennedy — it alleges that the government sought to suppress posts about the 2020 election and Hunter Biden’s laptop. The lawsuit says that ""efforts by federal officers to induce social-media platforms to censor speech appear to have begun in 2020,"" which would have been under Trump, and criticizes actions by the Biden administration, which started in January 2021. Although Kennedy received a preliminary injunction in the case, that February ruling was stayed until the U.S. Supreme Court rules in a related case brought by Missouri and Louisiana. The states accuse the Biden administration of breaching the First Amendment by discussing content moderation with social media companies, suppressing conservatives’ content about COVID-19 and voting by mail. The Justice Department argued , ""Social-media users have a First Amendment right to be free from governmental restrictions on their speech, but they have no First Amendment right to post content on private platforms that the platforms would prefer not to host."" Experts poke holes in ‘censorship’ characterization, but look to courts Sheri Berman, a political science professor at Barnard College at Columbia University, said Kennedy’s being among the people spreading false or dangerous information does not mean that the Biden administration ""was attacking him, as an individual citizen or as a potential opponent of Biden."" Berman said it’s reasonable for citizens and candidates to debate how much social media moderation should exist. ""However, general attempts to limit the spread of dangerous or false information about extremely sensitive and consequential topics — like elections results or the efficacy of vaccines during a pandemic — is not a threat to democracy,"" Berman said. Thomas Healy, a law professor at Seton Hall Law School, said the Supreme Court will ultimately resolve the question of whether the Biden administration engaged in censorship. ""The federal government is entitled to use the bully pulpit to advance its policy goals, and most modern administrations have done so,"" Healy said. ""Such communications would rise to the level of censorship only if the encouragement crossed the line into coercion, and that is a factual question."" Two lower courts ruled that the government likely did engage in coercion, but a majority of the Supreme Court seemed skeptical of that claim during March oral arguments. ""Even if the Supreme Court agrees with the lower courts that the Biden administration violated the First Amendment, its actions are a far cry from the punishment of political opponents we have seen at earlier moments in American history and that Donald Trump has promised to pursue if reelected,"" Healy said. Past presidents took actions against the press Whatever happens with the current court cases, history is clear about one thing: Past U.S. administrations have imposed far more extreme policies in response to government criticism. Four examples: President John Adams in 1798 signed the Sedition Act , which permitted the deportation, fine or imprisonment of anyone deemed a threat or who published ""false, scandalous, or malicious writing"" against the U.S. government. Many newspaper editors who criticized Adams’ administration were prosecuted. The unpopular law contributed to Adams’ presidential election defeat in 1800, and the law expired. Steven Levitsky, a government professor at Harvard University, called Kennedy’s comparison baseless and ""reckless."" ""In Adams' time,"" he said, ""newspapers were virtually the ONLY form of expression."" President Woodrow Wilson signed the Sedition Act of 1918 , which made it a crime to write or publish ""any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language"" about the government or the war effort. Wilson’s Justice Department brought about 2,000 indictments under the Espionage and Sedition Acts of 1917 and 1918, Healy, the Seton Hall law professor, said. One of the people jailed under the acts was Eugene Debs, the Socialist Party leader who ran for president against Wilson in 1912. Debs was arrested in 1918 after giving an antiwar speech and convicted of violating the Espionage Act of 1917. He ran for president in 1920 under the Socialist Party banner from a federal prison in Alabama and his prison sentence was later commuted. In 1917, Wilson issued an executive order creating the Records of the Committee on Public Information, which was a ""a vast effort in propaganda,"" Boston University journalism professor Christopher Daly wrote . The Justice Department in the late 1940s and 1950s under Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower prosecuted the Communist Party of America’s leaders under the Smith Act, which made it a crime to advocate for the U.S. government’s overthrow by violence or force, Healy said. ""The evidence against them showed that they were mainly teaching the doctrines of Marx and Lenin; there was no evidence that they were taking concrete steps to initiate a violent overthrow,"" Healy said. President Abraham Lincoln in May 1864 issued an executive order commanding Union Army Maj. Gen. John A. Dix to ""arrest and imprison in any fort or military prison in your command the editors, proprietors, and publishers"" of newspapers that printed a forged presidential proclamation calling for the drafting of 400,000 more troops. News accounts at the time said newspaper offices were seized and at least one proprietor was arrested. Our ruling Kennedy said ""President Biden is the first candidate in history, the first president in history, that has used the federal agencies to censor political speech ... to censor his opponent."" There are several factual issues with the claim. Kennedy was referring to a Biden administration official emailing Twitter in January 2021, asking the platform to remove Kennedy’s false post about the COVID-19 vaccine causing Hank Aaron’s death. Kennedy didn’t announce his presidential candidacy for more than two years after that post, which remains live on Twitter. Kennedy has sued the administration over its communications with social media companies. And courts are weighing whether these communications amount to censorship. But even if someone deems the Biden administration’s actions censorship, Kennedy is wrong about history. Presidents Adams and Wilson signed sedition legislation that made it a crime to criticize the federal government. Those laws led to the prosecution of political figures, including Debs, who ran for president. Their actions also targeted the free press. We rate this statement False.

Those include presidential, attorney general, gubernatorial and state Supreme Court races.","Wisconsin is used to tight elections. Razor-thin presidential races. Statewide cliffhangers. But when Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming claimed in a media call during Vice President Kamala Harris’ March 6 visit that ""We’ve had 12 elections in 24 years in Wisconsin that have been decided by less than 30,000 votes,"" it struck us as a lot. So, we decided to dig into the numbers. Close calls for a handful of statewide races When PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted state GOP spokesman Matt Fisher to determine which races Schimming was referring to, he supplied a list of 12. PolitiFact confirmed the results from those races with the Wisconsin Elections Commission election results archive and added the vote margin. This is how the races played out in the last 24 years: 2000 presidential – Republican candidate George W. Bush narrowly defeated Vice President Al Gore by 5,708 votes. 2004 presidential – Bush won again, beating out Democratic ticket of then-U.S. Sen. John Kerry by 11,384 votes. 2006 attorney general – Republican J.B. Van Hollen defeated then-Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk by 8,859 votes. 2008 Wisconsin Supreme Court – Conservative Michael J. Gableman secured victory against incumbent Justice Louis Butler with a 22,303 vote margin. 2011 Wisconsin Supreme Court – The incumbent justice, conservative David Prosser Jr., won a second 10-year term after defeating assistant Wisconsin Attorney General JoAnne Kloppenburg by 7,004 votes. 2016 presidential – Republican Donald Trump beat out former secretary of state and first lady of the United States Hillary Clinton by 22,784 votes. 2018 gubernatorial – Incumbent Republican Gov. Scott Walker lost his run for a third term after being defeated by Democratic challenger and then-Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers. Evers won with a 29,227 vote margin. 2018 attorney general race – Current Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, defeated Republican incumbent Brad Schimel by 17,190 votes. 2019 Wisconsin Supreme Court – Former Appeals Judge Brian Hagedorn defeated then-Appeals Chief Judge Lisa Neubauer with a 5,981 vote gap. 2020 presidential – The race saw current President and then-former Vice President Joe Biden beat incumbent Republican President, Donald Trump by 20,608 votes. 2022 U.S. Senate – Incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson won his re-election to a third term after defeating Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes by 26,718 votes. 2022 secretary of state – Incumbent Democrat Doug La Follette narrowly beat out Republican state legislator Amy Loudenbeck. He won a 12th term in office with a 7,442 vote margin. It’s worth noting that only two presidential contests in the last 24 years did not have close calls: 2008 and 2012.

In January 2019, Whitley, Texas’ then-secretary of state, issued a statement saying his office discovered that 95,000 noncitizens had a voter registration record in Texas. Voter registrations of people on the list who failed to provide proof of citizenship would be canceled, the statement said. A previous PolitiFact article found that the list of 95,000 names was created by cross-referencing people registered to vote with the names of people who said they were not citizens when they got a driver’s license or state identification card. In 2019 alone, 97,675 people became citizens in Texas, Department of Homeland Security data found. That means people on the list could have become naturalized after receiving their driver’s licenses. Days after Whitley issued the advisory, his office said that 25,000 of the names on the list were mistakenly added. In a February 2019 letter to lawmakers obtained by The Texas Tribune , Whitley apologized for errors in the list, writing, ""In hindsight, however, before announcing the number of people who may not be eligible to vote, more time should have been devoted to additional communication with the counties and DPS (Department of Public Safety) to further eliminate anyone from our original list who is, in fact, eligible to vote."" The incident led the Texas Senate to not confirm Whitley as secretary of state by the end of its 2019 legislative session; he resigned just before the session’s end. ""For those of us who’ve worked in Texas politics for years, it was a huge deal because you almost never see a gubernatorial appointee fail to get confirmed by the state senate,"" Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of Common Cause Texas, a voting advocacy group, told PolitiFact. ""It goes to show just how wildly false their claim of 95,000 non-citizens being on the voter rolls was that it resulted in the Republican-dominated Texas Legislature refusing to confirm the nomination of the Republican governor."" A lawsuit against Whitley was settled in April 2019 with an agreement that the then-secretary of state could not use the list to check voter’s citizenship status. We rate the claim that Texas found 95,000 noncitizens registered to vote False. "
"April 1, 2024",Derrick Van Orden,You can vote in-person absentee at your clerk’s office on Monday before Election Day.,false,"Early voting was no longer possible on April 1, when Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., made his tweet. State law allows for early voting between 14 days before the election and the Sunday before Election Day, leaving Monday out. Voters can still go to the polls in person April 2 and register to vote there.","In a change of tune from previous elections, Republicans have encouraged voters to ""bank"" their votes by casting their votes early at in-person absentee sites. That includes Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who represents western Wisconsin in Congress. On April 1, 2024, he wrote on X (formerly Twitter): ""Get out and vote in-person-absentee TODAY at your clerks office! (Or) in-person tomorrow at your designated polling station!"" Van Orden said. But for Wisconsin’s presidential primary election — held April 2 — early voting was offered only through March 31. Let’s clear up the dates for early voting in Wisconsin, and why that wasn’t an option at the time Van Orden made the claim. For presidential primary, clerks could offer early voting from March 19 to March 31 Van Orden’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the Wisconsin Elections Commission has a list of dates for the presidential primary, including the deadline for early voting. That list explains that early voting started on March 19, and can run through March 31. March 31 was Easter and marked the Sunday before Election Day. Communities can choose which dates in that range to have early voting, along with hours and locations. While it can take place at a clerk’s office, it can also be held at community centers and libraries, for example. For example, the city of Milwaukee offered early voting through March 30 and included locations such as the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Helene Zelazo Center for the Performing Arts. State law lays out time range, early voting can run through Sunday before Election Day The restriction on conducting early voting on Monday isn’t just for this election. It’s part of state law. ""If application is made in person, the application shall be made no earlier than 14 days preceding the election and no later than the Sunday preceding the election,"" state law says . Translation: In-person absentee can happen only between 14 days out from the election and the Sunday before Election Day (which is always a Tuesday). So, that means early voting is impossible Monday, which is when Van Orden made his tweet encouraging people to do so. And one more interesting point: Wisconsin does not allow for voter registration on the Saturday, Sunday or Monday before Election Day. So, early voting toward the end of that time range is not possible if you need to register or re-register. If that applies to you, registering at the polls is still an option. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. April 2. That second part of Van Orden’s claim is right: You can vote in-person at the polls tomorrow. Our ruling The day before Wisconsin’s presidential primary, U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., encouraged people to ""get out and vote in-person-absentee TODAY at your clerks office!"" But state law allows for early voting only through the Sunday before an Election Day. Early voting was not offered on the Monday before the election, when Van Orden made his claim. One more reminder for good measure: You can still go to your polling place April 2, and register to vote there if you need to. But Van Orden gave voters the impression they could vote in-person absentee April 1, when in fact that opportunity ended on March 31. We rate his claim False. "
"April 1, 2024",Donald Trump,"In 2020, Trump “did much better” in the Wisconsin election than 2016, and “after the wrongdoing was found, people said, ‘Well, he actually did win.’”",pants-fire,"Former President Donald Trump claimed he performed better in 2020 than 2016 in Wisconsin. He won the state in 2016 but lost in 2020. Recounts and reviews upheld Biden’s victory and found there was no widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. PolitiFact Wisconsin has debunked these claims before, and we’ll continue doing so as Trump repeats them in this cycle.","Former President Donald Trump repeated familiar false claims ahead of his first visit to Wisconsin this campaign cycle: that he actually won the state in 2020 and there was widespread voter fraud. On April 1, 2024 — a day before Wisconsin’s presidential primary and Trump’s first 2024 rally in the state — Trump appeared on WISN-AM’s Dan O’Donnell show. Trump incorrectly said he won Wisconsin in 2020. He did win the state in 2016, but lost in 2020. ""We had a reelection the second time. We actually did much better than the first time. We won in Wisconsin, as you know, the first time. The second time we did much better,"" Trump said. Trump also falsely claimed that he won after ""wrongdoing"" was discovered in the 2020 election. ""But I guess it was delayed,"" Trump continued. ""They found out a lot of wrongdoing. And after the wrongdoing was found, people said, ‘Well, he actually did win.’"" O’Donnell, a conservative talk radio host, did not push back on Trump’s false claims that he won the state in 2020 or that there was wrongdoing in the presidential election. PolitiFact Wisconsin has checked these claims before. But ahead of Trump’s rally in Green Bay let’s take a trip down memory lane. Trump did not win Wisconsin in 2020, though he did win the state in 2016 Let’s tackle the first part of Trump’s claim: That he performed better in Wisconsin in 2020 than he did in 2016. That is unequivocally false. And it’s something PolitiFact Wisconsin has checked on multiple occasions, including in 2021. We noted then, and we’ll repeat here, that President Joe Biden won Wisconsin in 2020. Biden took 1,630,866 votes compared to Trump’s 1,610,184 in the state, so Trump lost by 20,682 votes. Trump did win the state in 2016, taking more than 22,000 votes over Democrat Hillary Clinton. He netted 1,405,284 votes in Wisconsin in 2016. So, although Trump picked up more raw votes in 2020, his performance was not better because he ultimately lost by about 20,000 votes. PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out to Trump’s campaign for backup but did not hear back by deadline. Bottom line: Trump did not win Wisconsin in 2020. PolitiFact Wisconsin has repeatedly rated that claim Pants on Fire. Recounts affirmed Biden’s victory, no widespread fraud or wrongdoing In the second part of Trump’s claim, he says that he won after ""a lot of wrongdoing"" was discovered. Let’s look back again. In 2020, PolitiFact Wisconsin explained that recounts Trump requested upheld Biden’s victory. The net pickup for Biden was 74 votes in the heavily Democratic Milwaukee and Dane counties. So, Trump actually fell further behind. So, again, recounts affirmed that Biden won the election. PolitiFact Wisconsin has also debunked several claims that there was ""wrongdoing"" or pervasive voter fraud. That includes clarifying that late returns for Biden were because of how Milwaukee counts its absentee ballots , not fraud. We’ve also debunked his claim that absentee ballots were being dumped in rivers or creeks. On top of that, a probe led by former state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman — who has aligned with Trump and promoted his false claims — turned up no evidence the election was incorrectly called. The conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty also found no evidence of widespread fraud. State auditors also found voting machines worked properly. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: Even reviews led by conservatives found no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. PolitiFact Wisconsin found false Trump’s claims of pervasive ""wrongdoing"" many times before, and the same applies here. Our ruling In a radio interview, Trump repeated familiar false refrains. That is, that he won Wisconsin in 2020 and ""after the wrongdoing was found, people said, ‘Well, he actually did win.’"" Biden won the state in 2020. Recounts actually expanded Biden’s margin, and multiple reviews — including by conservatives — found there was no widespread voter fraud. PolitiFact Wisconsin has checked these claims before, and we’ll continue doing so if Trump airs them as he hits the ground in Wisconsin ahead of November. We’ve given a Pants on Fire rating for similar Trump claims in the past, and we do the same again here. "

"March 28, 2024",Sarah Godlewski,"“When it comes to how many votes (President) Joe Biden won, it was literally less than a few votes per ward.”",true,"Godlewski was referring to all wards in the state of Wisconsin, not a specific city or county. Taking President Joe Biden’s vote margin and dividing it by the total number of wards does result in about three voters per ward. Godlewski is taking wards together as an average, and different parts of the state would have delivered more or less votes for Biden.","At a rally in suburban Waukesha earlier this month , first lady Jill Biden and other Democratic officials laid out what’s at stake in the 2024 election, focusing on abortion and health care access. Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski was one of the speakers who took the stage before the first lady, asking a crowd of mostly women voters to talk to their neighbors and help get out the vote. ""When it comes to how many votes (President) Joe Biden won, it was literally less than a few votes per ward,"" Godlewski said. We often mention that Biden won Wisconsin in 2020 by a little more than 20,000 votes . But taking a look at the votes by ward could give an interesting picture of how competitive the election was – and could be again this fall. And other Democrats seem to be repeating the same message, including when Biden visited his new campaign headquarters in Milwaukee. ""In Wisconsin, every election comes down to three to four votes per ward,"" the state party’s Deputy Organizing Director Jaliah Jefferson said at that event. As the state heads for a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump, let’s look at how many votes it came down to by ward last time. Number came from dividing votes by total number of wards in Wisconsin When we asked for backup, Nathan Schwantes, Godlewski’s chief of staff, said the secretary of state was talking about the entire state of Wisconsin, not a specific city or county. He explained that Biden won the state by 20,682 votes (which is correct) and that Wisconsin had 6,656 wards where voters lived. That division results in 3.1 votes per ward. He added that there’s a slightly different count of wards in Wisconsin, which includes wards where no voters live. That number was 7,078, giving a result of 2.9 voters. State law says that wards are the ""building blocks"" for creating districts for local, state and federal offices. And ""all territory, even if unpopulated, must be contained in a ward."" That explains why some wards might not actually have voters in them. Schwantes shared an email from the nonpartisan Legislative Technology Services Bureau, which confirms the 7,078 number. That total was from July, because the next count was not taken until January. Whichever total ward number is used, the calculations result in around a few votes per ward. So, Godlewski’s math is correct. Calculation takes wards together as an average, though certain areas voted differently Wards vary widely in population. And blue areas of the state would have delivered many more votes for Biden per ward, and red areas would have delivered much less. For example, Biden lost Waukesha County to Trump — where Godlewski made the claim — by 55,743 votes. Looking at the ward-by-ward report of 2020 presidential results , Waukesha County had about 387 wards, so that comes down to about 144 votes per ward that Biden lost by. The similar claim, from Jefferson, simply said that elections in Wisconsin come down to a few votes per ward — not that Biden specifically won or lost those few votes everywhere. For comparison, in Milwaukee County — where Jefferson made her claim — Biden won over Trump by 183,045 votes. Milwaukee County had about 572 wards, coming down to about 320 votes per ward that Biden won by. Counties use ""reporting units"" to report results , which can be one ward or a group of wards. So, our analysis of those counties is an estimate and includes wards where no voters live — there are many like that in the City of Waukesha. Biden certainly didn’t win — or lose — by three votes per ward in every county, but it is the right average. It’s clear that Godlewski was speaking generally about the entire state. And presidents are elected based on how many electoral votes the entire state has, not by counties or wards. Our ruling At a Waukesha rally, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski said ""when it comes to how many votes Joe Biden won, it was literally less than a few votes per ward."" Although ""less than a few"" is open to interpretation, 2.9 or 3.1 is certainly a small number, considering that several hundred voters can live in one ward. And although her claim doesn’t require a caveat because presidents are elected statewide, we should still note that Biden’s vote-per-ward margin would have been larger or smaller in certain areas of the state. We rate her claim True. "

A lawsuit filed by two Montana-based groups seeks to block a 2023 state law, arguing that an accidental failure to deregister to vote after a move from out of state could lead to criminal liability, even though the voter has no intention of casting a ballot in both places. The groups’ lawsuit seeks to protect Montana from a law they say is vague, not an affirmative right for Montana voters to register to vote in a second state. Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy. Learn more .","Recently ousted Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel faced tough questions on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" over her support for former President Donald Trump’s evidence-free statements about a ""rigged"" 2020 election. McDaniel appeared March 24 on ""Meet the Press,"" just two days after NBC hired her as a paid commentator on its news programs. The decision to hire McDaniel prompted a backlash from prominent voices inside NBC News, including former ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd. They argued that McDaniel’s support for Trump’s claims raised questions about her credibility as a commentator. In the ""Meet the Press"" interview, McDaniel walked a tightrope, distancing herself from Trump’s most incendiary false rhetoric about the election and calling Joe Biden ""the legitimate president,"" while still asserting that there were legitimate ""concerns"" about the 2020 election. She said the Republican National Committee, now run by Michael Whatley and Trump daughter-in-law Lara Trump following McDaniel’s ouster, is involved with 78 ""election integrity"" lawsuits . ""I'll give you one example. One's in Montana right now with Democrats suing to say, ‘You should be allowed to be registered to vote in two states,’"" McDaniel said. ""Why are they suing on that?"" This doesn’t give the full story. Two liberal-leaning Montana-based groups have sued in federal court to block a law that establishes a criminal penalty for being registered to vote in more than one state. The groups argue that, under the law, people who move to Montana and fail to deregister to vote in their former state could face criminal liability, even though they don’t intend to vote in both places. Double voting is already illegal under existing Montana law. Montana, which has a Republican governor and a Republican-controlled Legislature, is defending the law. The lawsuit is pending, with the RNC granted the right to help argue the state’s position. McDaniel did not answer inquiries for this article placed with the Republican National Committee and NBC. What does the law do? The law in question, HB 892 , passed both legislative chambers with unanimous Republican support and some backing from Democratic legislators. Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, signed the bill in May 2023. The law says that people may not ""purposefully remain registered"" to vote in more than one place in Montana or another state. A violation carries a fine up to $5,000 and/or up to 18 months in prison. The Montana Public Interest Research Group, which works to register voters on college campuses, and the Montana Federation of Public Employees, a public employee union, sued in September 2023 to block the law. The lawsuit argues that the phrase ""purposefully remain registered"" is vague when referring to voters who don’t intend to vote in more than one jurisdiction. It says the criminal penalties ""have the effect of deterring potential Montana voters from registering."" The complaint argued that new college students in the state are particularly at risk because many of them had already registered in their home states before moving to Montana. ""The ambiguities of what they need to do to comply with H.B. 892 and avoid potentially severe criminal penalties will chill them from registering and voting in Montana,"" the complaint argues. The state is defending the law in federal court. In a response filed with the court, the state said the plaintiffs ""ignore the obvious fact that a registrant easily complies with H.B. 892 by simply providing their prior registration information. … If the resident provides the information, there is no reasonable risk of violation."" The response added that ""a person of ordinary intelligence can easily understand what is required of them in this context."" Oral arguments were held a few days before McDaniel’s ""Meet the Press"" interview. Being on voter rolls in two states is common, but double voting is rare Rachel Orey, senior associate director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said McDaniel’s statement ""incorrectly implies that plaintiffs are trying to give Montana voters an ability to register in two states that voters elsewhere lack."" ""What matters to election outcomes is not whether individuals are registered twice, but whether they vote twice,"" Orey said. Orey acknowledged that it’s ""not ideal to have voters registered in multiple states, as it results in wasted election office resources and can hurt voter confidence if a voter receives election mail for an individual who has since moved from that address."" However, standard list maintenance procedures and state-to-state collaboration can address the pitfalls of multiple registrations for a voter, Orey said, without resorting to ""overly restrictive"" laws that increase the risk of voters being disenfranchised. In Montana, election officials take steps to maintain the accuracy of voter rolls. Montana’s voter registration form asks applicants to provide previous registration information in another county or state. The Montana secretary of state’s office then sends a notice to the secretary of state’s office in the former state, said Bradley Seaman, Missoula County’s elections administrator. Montana election officials also receive similar notifications from other states, Seaman said. Being on the voter rolls in two states is not unusual nationwide. Media outlets in 2017 found several instances of Trump advisers , Trump administration members and family members who remained on the voter rolls in two states. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in California who served as the Biden administration’s first senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights, said double voting happens, but is ""exceedingly rare."" ""People who happen to be registered in more than one place are usually on the rolls in two places just because they haven’t bothered to remove their old registration (and the old state hasn’t gotten around to it yet), not because they plan to use both registrations to vote,"" Levitt said. There’s also a paper trail, which makes the federal crime of double voting ""straightforward to prosecute,""said Levitt. The Electronic Registration Information Center was designed to help states screen for people registered in more than one state. The consortium, which includes about half the states, allows intrastate sharing of voter registration data. Montana is not a member. Our ruling McDaniel said Montana Democrats are ""suing to say, ‘You should be allowed to be registered to vote in two states.’"" McDaniel misrepresented the lawsuit. Two Montana-based groups filed a lawsuit that seeks to block a 2023 state law, arguing that it makes failing to deregister to vote after a move from out of state a crime, even if the voter doesn’t intend to cast a ballot in both places. McDaniel’s statement has an element of truth, in that overturning the law would mean people would not be prosecuted for simply being registered in two states. But McDaniel’s claim gives listeners the wrong impression, because the plaintiffs are not seeking an affirmative right for Montana voters to register to vote in a second state. Instead, they want to protect voters who unintentionally failed to cancel their registration in their previous state of residence from being charged with a crime. We rate her claim Mostly False.

A March 9 Facebook post shared a list of 65 activities that require ""valid IDs,"" including driving a car, buying alcohol or cigarettes, boarding a plane and applying for a job. The only thing that doesn’t require a valid ID, the post says, is ""voting."" This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Screengrab from Facebook) Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a 2024 Republican presidential candidate until this month, in 2022 shared a similar claim that voter ID was not required; we rated that Mostly False . Has much changed since then? Not really. Voter ID laws vary across the country, but in most states, voters must verify their identity in some way at the polls. The National Conference of State Legislatures said 36 states have laws that require or request some form of identification to vote in person. Those laws applied to about 62% of registered voters in the 2022 election, according to U.S. Census Bureau data . The laws in these 36 states vary as to whether they are strictly applied and whether a photo ID or another form of identification is accepted. Ten states — Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin — have what the conference labels as ""strict"" photo ID laws. This means that voters who lack acceptable photo IDs must vote a provisional ballot and take additional steps to verify their identity after Election Day for their ballot to be counted. Three states — Arizona, North Dakota and Wyoming — have ""strict"" ID laws, according to the conference, but photo ID is not the only identification accepted. In Arizona, for example, a recent utility bill or bank statement are acceptable forms of ID. In 23 states, the voter ID laws are what the conference considers ""nonstrict,"" meaning in most cases, voters without acceptable identification can cast a regular ballot without having to take further action after Election Day. For instance, a voter without proper identification may sign an affidavit or poll workers may vouch for a voter’s identity. Eleven of these ""nonstrict"" states accept only photo IDs; the other 12 states accept photo IDs and other forms of identification. The remaining 14 states and Washington, D.C., do not require any form of identification to vote at the polls, NCSL said. These states and Washington, D.C., which together accounted for about 38% of registered voters in 2022, use other methods to verify voters’ identities , such as matching voters’ signatures or asking voters for personal information. Federal law requires first-time voters who register to vote by mail and didn’t provide proof of identification at the time of registration, to show a valid photo ID or another form of ID, such as a current paycheck, bank statement or government document that shows the voter’s name and address, the conference said. States have different laws and procedures for verifying the identity of voters who cast mail ballots. In 22 states, voters applying for a mail ballot must show ID, provide an ID number, such as from a driver’s license or Social Security card, or obtain a witness or notary signature, according to the Voting Rights Lab , an organization that tracks state election laws and proposed legislation. In 21 other states, the Voting Rights Lab said, voters requesting mail ballots must verify their identity using personal information, such as date of birth, address or signature. The remaining seven states and Washington, D.C., have universal mail voting, so ballots are automatically sent to voters ahead of every election, without voters needing to request them, the Voting Rights Lab said. Election officials in every state use signature verification to validate the identities of voters who cast mail ballots, the National Vote at Home Institute said. After the 2020 election, many Republican lawmakers sympathetic to former President Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud have pushed for tighter voter ID requirements to combat fraud, which national experts have said is isolated and rare. Democrats and voting rights advocates have criticized some state voter ID laws, particularly ones with narrow lists of acceptable types of ID, as overly burdensome. Our ruling A Facebook post claimed that valid IDs are not required to vote in U.S. elections. But there isn’t a total absence of voter ID laws in the U.S. In 36 states, voters are required or requested to present some form of ID to cast a ballot in person. These laws applied to about 6 in 10 voters in the 2022 elections. The remaining 14 states and Washington, D.C., use other methods to verify voters’ identities. Federal law requires first-time voters to present valid ID when requesting mail ballots, and almost half the states have additional ID requirements for voters applying for mail ballots. We rate this claim Mostly False. "
"March 14, 2024",Instagram posts,The 2020 election was the only time in American history that an election took more than 24 hours to count.,false,"There has never been a presidential election in which every vote has been counted within 24 hours. Official results take days to weeks to certify, experts said. Media organizations can call races before every vote is counted. There are several examples of presidential and state elections that took longer than the 2020 presidential election to call. Learn more about PolitiFact’s fact-checking process and rating system.","How long does it typically take to count all the votes in a presidential election? According to social media influencer Andrew Tate, the answer is less than 24 hours. Tate, who is on trial for human trafficking , was featured in a recent Instagram video, talking about the 2020 election. ""Never in the history of an election in America has the results taken more than 24 hours to count,"" Tate said in the March 8 post . ""Never in history. Here we are seven days later, they’re not finished."" This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. The Instagram clip of Tate comes from a Nov. 21, 2020, podcast on Romanian fitness influencer Andy Popescu’s YouTube channel. The 2020 election did not represent the first time presidential election vote counting took longer than 24 hours. In fact, experts said, it has always taken more than 24 hours to count presidential election ballots. Perhaps the most memorable example: The 2000 presidential election between then-Vice President Al Gore and then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, which was decided more than a month after Election Day when the Supreme Court stopped a manual recount and declared Bush the winner. ""The United States has never counted all the ballots in a federal general election in 24 hours,"" David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonprofit that promotes trust in election security, told PolitiFact. ""Every single state takes days or even weeks to certify official counts, by design, to ensure that the counts are final and accurate."" The U.S. Election Assistance Commission, a federal agency that provides information on election administration, says on its website that the results reported on election night ""are never the final, certified results."" Media organizations often call the election winners before the official count is over based on early ballots and data on demographics and voting history . ""Election night ‘winners’ are those that the media has projected will win based on the margin of victory of votes already counted versus the volume of bills outstanding,"" Tammy Patrick, chief executive officer of programs at the National Association of Election Officials, told PolitiFact. ""There are always ballots still being processed — that is why EVERY state has their official canvass days, even weeks later."" In the 2016 presidential election, The Associated Press called Trump the winner at 2:29 a.m. EST on Nov. 9, before the organization finished calling every state, based on Trump winning the necessary number of electoral votes. Congress met nearly two months later, on Jan. 6, 2017 , to officially certify the election. ""That’s to ensure the counts are complete and verified,"" Becker said. In 2020, it took four days to tally enough ballots for media outlets to call the election. That election took longer than the previous presidential election to call because pandemic restrictions led to a historic amount of mail and early ballots , which take longer to count than in-person Election Day votes. The counting process for mail ballots is not uniform across states. Fifteen states, including Maine, Minnesota and Virginia, do not allow absentee votes to be counted until after the polls close, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Michigan and Wisconsin did not allow mail ballots to be counted before Election Day 2020, Becker said. That is why the graphs in the Instagram clip show that Biden overtook Trump’s lead after the polls closed. More recent state elections have taken even longer to call. For example, Minnesota’s 2008 U.S. Senate race was declared eight months after Election Day, and a 2010 Alaska U.S. Senate race was called after two weeks. We rate the claim that the 2020 election was the only time in American history that an election took more than 24 hours to count False. "

""And what does President Biden do? Well, he bans TikTok for government employees, but creates an account for his own campaign,"" she said March 7. ""You can’t make this stuff up."" Britt is correct in saying that Biden’s campaign uses TikTok, even after he limited its access for federal government employees. In signing the Consolidated Appropriations Act in 2022, Biden generally barred federal government employees from using TikTok on agency-owned devices. There are exceptions for law enforcement, national security interests and security research. NBC News reported in 2023 that Biden’s campaign would not be on TikTok, citing three anonymous sources. But on Feb. 11, on the day of the Super Bowl LVIII, "" BidenHQ "" posted its first TikTok video — a cheeky reference to the Taylor Swift-as-CIA asset conspiracy theory . Wired and The Associated Press reported that the campaign uses a separate device specifically to log into and access TikTok, isolating it from communications on other devices. In recent days, the White House has embraced a bipartisan bill that would prevent ByteDance-owned apps from appearing on app stores or U.S. websites. This means ByteDance would need to sell TikTok or face a national ban. We asked Biden’s campaign for comment on this and didn’t hear back. PolitiFact has a fact-checking partnership with TikTok; you can read more about it here . Britt said Biden banned government employees from using TikTok while using it for his campaign.

Because of you, we had the establishment running scared — withstanding 3 to 1 in TV spending and an onslaught of billionaires spending millions to rig this election. (1/) — Katie Porter (@katieporteroc) March 6, 2024 Facing criticism of her use of the term ""rig"" — including from Democrats — Porter later elaborated. ""‘Rigged’ means manipulated by dishonest means,"" she wrote in a statement posted to X. ""A few billionaires spent $10 million+ on attack ads against me, including an ad rated ‘false’ by an independent fact checker. That is dishonest means to manipulate an outcome."" In that statement, she wrote, ""I said ‘rigged by billionaires’ and our politics are — in fact — ""manipulated by big dark money."" ""At no time have I ever undermined the vote count and election process in CA, which are beyond reproach,"" she added . Please find a statement from me below. pic.twitter.com/as8H2cHWL8 — Katie Porter (@katieporteroc) March 7, 2024 When contacted for comment, a Porter campaign spokesperson pointed us back to her statement on X and to Merriam-Webster’s definitions of the verb ""rig,"" one of which reads, ""to manipulate or control usually by deceptive or dishonest means."" Another of the definitions says ""rig"" is ""to fix in advance for a desired result."" Porter’s posts landed in a fraught political environment in which former President Donald Trump and his supporters have consistently asserted that the 2020 presidential election was ""rigged."" The allegations have been widely rebutted by the courts. PolitiFact has repeatedly rated false and misleading claims about ""rigged"" U.S. elections . Sometimes Democrats have joined in with similar language. In 2019, after Democrat Stacey Abrams lost the 2018 Georgia governor race to Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, Abrams claimed the ""system is rigged"" and repeatedly suggested the election was stolen . (PolitiFact found no proof that voter suppression kept Abrams from winning the 2018 governor’s contest.) Rigging an election might refer to buying votes, tampering with voting machines or stuffing a ballot box. In Porter’s case, she faced an onslaught of opposition spending, some of it by wealthy entities with little or no disclosure required. However, spending unlimited amounts of money to buy ads is legal, as long as the spenders do not coordinate with candidates. Democracy and elections experts said people might disagree about whether such tactics should be legal, but this spending did not assure Porter’s loss or amount to a ""rigged"" election. California’s Senate primary California uses an unusual top-two primary system in which the candidates who finish in first and second place both advance to the general election — regardless of their party affiliation. Although votes are still being counted, Porter is headed toward a third-place finish behind Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and Republican Steve Garvey, a former Major League Baseball player. Garvey entered the race in October, following months of rumors about his possible candidacy. Garvey often polled below Schiff and close to Porter, according to FiveThirtyEight data . Some news reports before the election characterized the race as one for second place between Porter and Garvey. The effect of California Senate race spending In February, Schiff’s campaign released a television ad contrasting him with Garvey. This tactic was expected to accomplish two goals for Schiff: to burnish his image for Democrats, and to make Republican voters aware of Garvey, potentially vaulting him above Porter and making the general election contest easier for Schiff in the solidly blue state. Outside money played a role, too. A pro-Schiff political action committee bankrolled a 30-second ad in February that criticized Garvey for his conservative views and noted his past support for Trump. Around the same time these ads appeared, polling showed Garvey’s support increasing. Polling showed that after the ads aimed at boosting Garvey began airing, Porter saw a modest increase in support. In her post-election comments, however, Porter highlighted a different example of outside spending. Fairshake, a political action committee linked to cryptocurrency industry leaders , paid for the campaign ad Porter called ""dishonest"" and that she alleged ""rigged"" the election against her. In the 2024 election cycle so far, Fairshake has spent $11.2 million on federal elections, with about $10 million of that spent opposing Porter , according to data from Open Secrets, a nonpartisan research group that tracks federal money in politics. Fairshake’s ad claimed Porter accepted donations ""from Big Pharma, Big Oil and the Big Bank executives"" — a claim The Sacramento Bee fact-checked and rated ""mostly false,"" describing it as ""misleading to viewers."" Spending such as this is legal under the 2010 Supreme Court decision, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission . ""That’s a fact, whether we like it or not,"" said Daniel Weiner, director of the Elections and Government Program at New York University Law School’s Brennan Center for Justice, a group that advocates for expanding voting rights. Billionaires spending unlimited amounts of money on ads opposing Porter would not be considered ""illegal acts designed to change the outcome of the election,"" he said. Political action committees cannot be financed by prohibited sources such as foreign groups and cannot coordinate with campaigns, Weiner said. He characterized the Federal Election Commission’s rules for what constitutes coordination as ""pretty weak."" Other political experts said that what occurred fell well short of rigging. They agreed that Porter’s failure to secure one of the top two spots owes more to Schiff’s yearslong cultivation of California voters and Porter’s political shortcomings than rigging. ""If a well-endorsed established politician beats a relative newcomer, that’s politics,"" said Robin Kolodny, a Temple University political scientist. In American politics, experts say, money is a necessary component of a winning campaign but it is not the only one. In 2022, eight of the 10 congressional candidates with the most self-funding lost. In California, it is not uncommon to see well-financed candidates lose . Voters cast their ballot on Super Tuesday, at the Ranchito Elementary School polling station March 5, 2024, in Los Angeles’ Panorama City section. (AP) Some Democrats, democracy experts didn’t support Porter’s term Experts said Porter’s use of ""rigged"" echoes rhetoric she’s used against financial institutions during her political career. ""Populist candidates and activists are especially prone to blaming the system, because it maintains their belief that the system needs radical change for justice and social justice to prevail,"" said Wayne Steger, a DePaul University political scientist. Democrats, including Sens. Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Alex Padilla of California, a former California secretary of state, criticized Porter’s use of the term ""rigged."" Steve Schale, a longtime Democratic strategist based in Florida, also rebutted Porter’s statement in an X post. Schale told PolitiFact he believes it’s unhealthy rhetoric. ""All you are doing is playing into the narrative that nobody actually loses,"" Schale said. ""One thing that makes our democracy work is people acknowledge they lose elections. There is nothing more important to our democracy than people acknowledging they lose elections."" Michael Thorning, structural democracy director at the Bipartisan Policy Center, agreed with Schale, calling Porter’s comment that billionaires spent money to rig the election ""completely irresponsible and unserious"" in a March 7 X post . The Brennan Center’s Weiner said Porter was calling attention to a ""very real structural problem"" that can disadvantage voters and candidates with less money. But he said he would not have used the term ""rig"" to discuss the issue because in the current political environment false claims about election rigging are ""designed to delegitimize our democratic institutions."" Our ruling Porter said billionaires ""rigged"" the California senate primary election through ""dishonest means,"" citing outside funding that supported attack ads against her. Outside funding for ads is legal and is not equivalent to predetermining a particular result. Rigging typically refers to things such as vote buying, ballot box stuffing or tampering with voting machines. It is based on limiting voter choice, and in the California race voters were free to choose among the candidates as they saw fit. We rate this claim False.

"March 7, 2024",Donald Trump,“Eighty-two percent of the country understands that (the 2020 election) was a rigged election.”,false,,"GREENSBORO — Former President Donald Trump told his North Carolina supporters during a campaign stop that he’s not the only one who believes the 2020 presidential election was rigged against him. ""Eighty-two percent of the country understands that it was a rigged election,"" Trump said March 2 during a rally at the Greensboro Coliseum Complex. ""You can’t have a country with that. A poll came out: 82%. But they go after the people — they don’t go after the people that rig the election, they go after the people (that are) looking."" First, the 2020 election was not rigged and numerous reviews have confirmed that President Joe Biden won 51% of the vote. States certified the results. Congress accepted the results. Trump and his allies lost more than 60 lawsuits claiming otherwise. A group of conservatives, including former federal judges, examined every fraud and miscount claim by Trump and concluded that they ""failed to present evidence of fraud or inaccurate results significant enough to invalidate the results."" Still, Trump has only amplified this false claim. Could he be right that now 82% of Americans are buying his line? We asked members of Trump’s campaign team about the 82% figure in Greensboro, but received no response. We searched the internet for a survey with that number from a credible polling company, but couldn’t find one. It reminded us of a 2022 check we did on a claim that 65% of Americans doubted the 2020 election, but we found that one to be False . Other media outlets have also failed to substantiate his recent 82% figure. So, we asked polling experts across the nation: Is there any truth to Trump’s claim that up to 82% of Americans believe the 2020 presidential election was rigged? Their answer: No. Dave McLennan, director of the Meredith Poll at Meredith College in Raleigh said although several polls ask respondents whether the 2020 election was fair and legitimate, none of them show that a majority of Americans think that contest was fraudulent, ""much less 82%, as Trump claims. ""Even if you look at Republicans, the percentage that claim that the election was stolen is not as high as Trump claims,"" McLennan said in an email. Available data shows that Trump’s claim is ""absurd,"" Alexander Theodoridis, co-director of the UMass Amherst Poll at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said in an email. A January Umass Amherst Poll found that 30% of respondents believed Biden’s win was illegitimate. Theodoridis noted that even among former Republican members of Congress — who were involved in government and could access detailed information about elections — more than 80% said Biden’s victory was legitimate. Polling groups have surveyed Americans multiple times about the 2020 presidential election’s legitimacy and none of their findings support Trump’s claim. Here’s a smattering of poll findings since we last examined this issue. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll from December found that 36% of respondents viewed Biden’s win as illegitimate. An August poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 70% of respondents believed Biden was legitimately elected. Among Republicans, the number was 57%. A June Monmouth University poll found that 30% of respondents believe Biden won the 2020 election because of voter fraud. Among Republicans, the number was 68% — still lower than Trump claimed. That result ""has been a nearly constant percentage in Monmouth’s polling since the November 2020 election,"" Monmouth noted in its report . An early 2022 Axios-SurveyMonkey poll found that 55% respondents believed Biden won legitimately. SurveyMonkey and the AP-NORC polls have lower credibility ratings than Monmouth and The Washington Post with FiveThirtyEight.com , which analyzes polling methods. Trump may have been referring to a 2021 survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute, a public opinion research firm. Thirty-one percent of the poll’s respondents said they believed the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump — but the number was much higher for respondents who consumed conservative media. Among Republicans who claimed they trust Fox News more than any other outlet, 82% said they believed the election was stolen. Polling results consistently show a partisan divide over the election’s legitimacy, said Alejandra Campos, a Latino Studies professor in the University of Arkansas’ political science department. Still, ""the available data does not support the claim that a majority of Americans thought the 2020 election was rigged,"" Campos said. Our ruling Trump said, ""82% of the country understands that it was a rigged election."" We couldn’t find any credible poll — or any group of polls — with results that support Trump’s claim. His campaign also produced no evidence to support it. Polling continues to show that most Americans believe the 2020 election was legitimate. We rate Trump’s claim False.

""Dems won’t deport, because every illegal is a highly likely vote at some point,"" Musk wrote on X Feb. 26 . ""That simple incentive explains what seems to be insane behavior."" Musk’s post also referred to immigrants illegally in the U.S. who are accused of assaulting New York City police officers. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said that the reported migrants who were recorded on video assaulting police should be deported. Musk’s post shared another person’s X post about the murder of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old University of Georgia nursing student who was killed Feb. 22 while on a run. Authorities charged Jose Ibarra, a 26-year-old from Venezuela, with the murder. U.S. Customs and Border Protection stopped Ibarra when he illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in September 2022, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Ibarra was paroled in, allowing him to be released into the U.S. to await further immigration proceedings. The Nashville Tea Party, a conservative group, posted Musk’s statement on Instagram about a week later. This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Musk has repeatedly posted similar statements about Democrats ""importing voters"" or illegal immigrants and voters. These statements by Musk — and similar ones by former President Donald Trump and J,D, Vance , now a Republican U.S. Senator from Ohio — are wrong. We contacted X’s press team asking for Musk’s evidence and received an automated response: ""Busy now, please check back later."" Democratic presidents have removed, returned or expelled millions of people Presidents, including Democrats, have removed and returned immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally for years, as federal government data shows. David Bier, associate director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Musk’s statement is ""ludicrously untrue."" Bier pointed to data from the Department of Homeland Security showing that Biden and former Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have returned, removed or expelled millions of people. During each of his terms, Obama removed and returned more people than Trump did. There have been more than 3.6 million removals, returns and expulsions from February 2021, Biden’s first month in office, to September 2023, based on Department of Homeland Security estimates. Voting by immigrants in the U.S. illegally carries serious risks Federal law requires U.S. citizenship to vote in national elections, and would-be voters sign a form that attests under penalty of perjury that they are citizens when they register to vote. States can check databases to verify voters’ citizenship. Voting by noncitizens carries high risks that include deportation or incarceration. There are incidents of noncitizens voting in elections, but they are sporadic among millions of votes cast in federal elections. Immigrants who cross the border illegally are typically looking for jobs and many are escaping poverty or crime — most don’t want to risk drawing government authorities’ attention by casting a ballot. ""There is a massive economic incentive to migrate here illegally,"" Bier wrote on X . ""There’s a massive economic disincentive to vote illegally."" As we explained in a recent fact-check of Trump , fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens often results from misunderstandings or errors. For example, some noncitizens accidentally register to vote when applying for a driver’s license. But the number of people who fall into this category is ""minuscule,"" Rutgers University political science professor Lorraine Minnite previously told us . In 2020, federal prosecutors charged 19 people in North Carolina with voter fraud after they cast ballots mostly in the 2016 election. Sixteen people pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors related to voting as a noncitizen; three cases were dismissed. That was a big case, but more than 4.5 million people in North Carolina voted in the 2016 presidential election. It takes years for immigrants to gain the right to vote. It takes several years for an immigrant to become a citizen and gain voting rights. ""It takes on average five years in green card status before a person can become a U.S. citizen, so no one would instantly gain the right to vote,"" Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson for the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, previously told PolitiFact . Not all immigrants who become citizens will vote. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that in the 2022 election, native-born citizen voter turnout was 53.4%, exceeding the 41.4% turnout of naturalized citizens. There is some evidence that immigrants lean left, but there are variations depending on their backgrounds and where they live. A 2023 national poll by KFF and the Los Angeles Times found that 37% of naturalized citizens say the Democratic Party represents their views better than the Republican party while 21% say the Republican Party does. But large shares of poll respondents leaned toward neither party. But there is no guarantee that immigrants who become citizens in the future will vote for Democrats. Bier told us that ""there is zero evidence that immigration has harmed Republican Party prospects."" Congressional Republicans have performed much better during periods when the immigrant share of the population is high, Bier wrote in 2019 . Our ruling Musk said Democrats don’t deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally ""because every illegal is a highly likely vote at some point."" Musk provided no evidence to support his statement about deportation or voting. The Biden administration, and previous Democratic administrations, have deported millions of immigrants. Immigrants cannot vote until they become citizens, a process that takes several years. We rate this statement False.

"March 5, 2024",Voto Latino .,"""There are less than two weeks until the deadline to register to vote in Wisconsin.""",barely-true,"Social media ads sponsored by Voto Latino say Wisconsin’s voter registration deadline is ""rapidly approaching"" and ""less than two weeks"" away. The deadline to register online or by mail for the April 2 election is March 13, which was less than two weeks away when one ad was circulating. But the ads don’t disclose that you can also register at your clerk’s office by March 29, or at the polls on Election Day in Wisconsin.","Wisconsin holds its presidential primary April 2. That’s long after many states hold their contests, including 15 states on March 5, Super Tuesday. But you might have seen recent ads on Instagram or Facebook that give the impression that Wisconsin’s primary is much earlier — or at least the deadline to register to vote in it. ""There are less than two weeks until the deadline to register to vote in Wisconsin,"" says one ad found Feb. 29 on Instagram. Another post advertised a few days later on Facebook read: ""Deadline rapidly approaching to register to vote in Wisconsin."" The ads are sponsored by Voto Latino, ""a civic engagement organization focused on educating and empowering a new generation of Latinx voters,"" according to its website . The nonprofit also advocates for liberal policy positions, such as paid sick leave and access to abortion. But as some online commenters pointed out, Wisconsin has ""same-day"" registration, meaning voters are able to register at the polls on April 2 — which is well over two weeks away. Let’s clear up the deadlines to register to vote in the April presidential primary election in Wisconsin. Deadline to register to vote online or via mail is March 13 Voto Latino, which did not respond to an inquiry for this PolitiFact, seems to be referring to the deadline to register to vote online or by mail. Another video ad clarifies they’re talking about registering online. The deadline to register to vote online or mail a registration form before the April 2 election is March 13 — which was, at the time one of Voto Latino’s ads was circulating, less than two weeks away. According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission , you can register online or by mail up to 20 days before the election. If you have a driver’s license or ID card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, you can register online at myvote.wi.gov. Or, you can mail your local clerk a voter registration form , which you can also start filling out at that website. But registering later at your clerk’s office, or at the polls, is still an option But those two options, which have an upcoming deadline, aren’t your only chances to register to vote in the April primary. The Wisconsin Elections Commission says you can also register in-person at your local clerk’s office ""up until the Friday before the election at 5:00 p.m. or close of business, whichever is later."" For this election, that date is March 29. Or, you can register at your polling place on Election Day. Polls are open from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. in Wisconsin.

The ads give a false sense of urgency where there really is none. Voters who miss the ""rapidly approaching"" deadline might be led to believe they don’t have another chance to register. There is a March 13 deadline to register online or by mail. But there are two additional ways to register: at your clerk’s office through March 29, or at the polls April 2.

The law never took effect. Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy. Learn more.,"With one sentence, Fox News host Sean Hannity misinformed millions of viewers about voting rights in New York City. During the Feb. 29 episode of his prime-time show ""Hannity,"" which averages 2.36 million viewers, the host falsely claimed that immigrants in the U.S. illegally are allowed to vote in New York City elections. Hannity was interviewing former President Donald Trump at the U.S. southern border. During a discussion about migrants entering the country, Trump said migrants are being allowed into the U.S. because the Biden administration ""maybe want(s) the votes,"" and that Democrats are trying to ""register people right now as we speak,"" a claim we previously rated Pants on Fire ! Hannity responded, ""In New York City, for example, local elections, illegal immigrants can vote."" The show cut to a commercial break and let the inaccurate claim stand. New York City passed 2021 legislation that would have allowed some immigrants to vote in municipal elections. But that law never took effect. We contacted Fox News for comment and did not receive a reply. (Internet Archive) Trump’s speculation about registering immigrants in the country illegally to vote echoes the discredited and racist ""great replacement"" conspiracy theory that says Democrats support increased immigration as part of a plan to replace white people with nonwhite people. Trump and other Republicans have pushed the theory in recent months. Noncitizens cannot vote in New York City municipal elections In 2021, New York City lawmakers approved legislation that would have allowed about 800,000 noncitizen New York residents to vote in municipal elections, if they had lived in the city for 30 days and were legal permanent residents of the U.S. or had work authorization. The legislation would have applied to local elections. Only U.S. citizens are allowed to vote in national elections. The New York City law was immediately challenged in court and never took effect. Nonetheless, it has been central to false claims that immigrants in the country illegally can vote in New York. In June 2022, before the law was scheduled to take effect, a New York judge struck it down , saying the measure violated the state constitution’s provision that ""every citizen"" is entitled to vote. That decision was appealed. On Feb. 21 , a New York appeals court agreed with the lower court’s decision: ""We determine that this local law was enacted in violation of the New York State Constitution and Municipal Home Rule Law, and thus, must be declared null and void."" It is unclear whether the ruling will be appealed again. Some cities across the U.S. have passed legislation to allow noncitizens to vote in some municipal elections, but that practice is not widespread . Our ruling Hannity claimed in New York City ""local elections, illegal immigrants can vote."" New York City passed 2021 legislation that would have granted some noncitizens the right to vote in local elections.

This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Data collected by Michigan’s State Department shows that out of the 768,256 votes cast in Michigan’s Democratic primary, 478,072 Democratic votes were submitted as absentee ballots — so, more than half of the votes cast were absentee. But there is no evidence that those votes were casted without a signature or identification. To verify a ballot, Michigan’s voting rules require clerks to check signatures on absentee ballot requests and absentee ballot envelopes against the signatures voters have on file. Voters who apply for absentee ballots must be registered to vote. To register to vote in Michigan , people must provide proof of identity. Michigan and most other states do not ask for a copy of the voter’s ID to be returned with the absentee ballot, although a few states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Minnesota and Ohio do have this requirement, according to information by the National Conference of State Legislatures . We searched Google and the Nexis news database and found no credible reports of absentee ballot voter fraud in Michigan’s presidential primary race. PolitiFact has previously debunked claims of voter fraud in Michigan’s 2022 midterm elections and the state’s 2020 presidential election . Biden received 81% of Democratic votes in the primary and nearly 19% were cast to other Democratic candidates or marked as ""uncommitted,"" part of a protest effort against Biden’s support of Israel in the war against Hamas.

"February 28, 2024",Deborah Ross,“North Carolina has the longest voting period in the country … and we have the most ways of voting.”,half-true,"In general elections, North Carolina distributes ballots before any other state. For primary elections, though, the state's voting period doesn't stand out. Election experts added: Offering a variety of voting options doesn't necessarily mean a state makes voting easy.","A Democratic congresswoman from North Carolina says the battleground state offers voters more time to participate in elections than in any other state. U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross on Jan. 25 announced a bill to make each state’s congressional redistricting processes more transparent — an effort that follows a contentious redistricting effort in her home state. North Carolina legislators on both sides of the aisle have a history of drawing new election maps behind closed doors, raising suspicion among opponents that they’re influenced by outside political groups. Ross concluded a recent press conference by addressing the media, ""Please remind your readers and your viewers that you can start voting in the primary already."" She added, ""North Carolina has the longest voting period in the country, because we’re a military state, and we have the most ways of voting."" North Carolina is home to several military bases. To comply with federal voting laws accommodating members of the military, the state mails absentee ballots to eligible U.S. citizens overseas at least 45 days before an election. We wondered about the timeframe for civilian voters, though. Does North Carolina offer the longest voting period in the nation? The answer: for one major type of election — but not for the other. General versus primary absentee voting periods To judge voting periods, Ross measured the length of time between two dates: when absentee ballots are mailed to voters, and the final day a ballot can be postmarked. PolitiFact North Carolina also considered the final day an absentee ballot could be accepted. To check Ross’ claim, we relied on information from the National Conference of State Legislators , a bipartisan organization advocating for the interests of state governments. The NCSL tracks election laws in each state. We also contacted election officials in states that appeared to have some of the longest voting periods. General elections : When it comes to general elections — typically held in November on even-numbered years — North Carolina stands out. North Carolina is the only state that mails absentee ballots to voters 60 days before the general election. North Carolina elections officials will begin mailing out absentee ballots on Sept. 6 for the Nov. 5 general election. Delaware state law allows for absentee ballots to be sent up to 60 days in advance of a general election, as the NCSL noted. But that’s not what happens in practice, according to the office of Delaware’s state election commissioner. Absentee ballots are typically mailed 30 to 45 days before an election, a spokeswoman for the Delaware office told PolitiFact. North Carolina also stands apart from Delaware and other states because it’s a "" no-excuse "" absentee state — meaning any voter can request an absentee ballot without providing a reason, such as being sick or out of town. In other words, for general elections, North Carolina has the longest voting period in the nation that’s open to every registered voter. Primary elections : North Carolina’s absentee voters have comparatively less time to fill out their ballot during primary elections. North Carolina state statutes instruct elections boards to mail absentee ballots 50 days before a primary and allow the state elections board to shorten the window to 45 days. That’s what the board voted to do this year to account for the federal Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday on Jan. 15. North Carolina started mailing out absentee ballots Jan. 19 for the March 5 primary. Compared with other states, North Carolina’s 45-day primary voting period is long — but it’s not the longest. Here are some states that caught our attention: Alabama allows absentee voting to start 55 days ahead of its elections. Eligible absentee voters started receiving ballots on Jan. 10 for the March 5 primary, Jeff Elrod, the state’s director of elections, told PolitiFact. Wisconsin separates its presidential primary from others. Although absentee ballots will be mailed to civilians less than a month before the April 2 presidential preference election, they’ll go out 47 days ahead of the Aug. 13 primary for congressional and legislative races. South Dakota’s absentee voting window is 46 days long. The state will begin mailing ballots on April 19 for its June 4 primaries, said Rachel Soulek, director of elections for the Secretary of State’s office. Elections officials in Michigan and Pennsylvania told us that it’s possible for absentee ballots to be mailed 50 days before a primary, but that delivery dates vary by county and ballots don’t always go out that early. Like North Carolina, Minnesota and Virginia began mailing out ballots on Jan. 19 ahead of their March 5 primaries. However, they allow ballots to arrive later than North Carolina does. In North Carolina, absentee and mail-in ballots must arrive before polls close at 7:30 on Election Day. In Minnesota , they’re due by 8 p.m. on Election Day. In Virginia , they must be postmarked by Election Day but can be received as late as noon on the Friday following the election. Ways to vote Ross also said North Carolina offers the ""most ways of voting."" North Carolina does offer a wide range of voting methods : absentee-by-mail, absentee through online portal (for military, eligible overseas and visually impaired voters), in-person early voting, in-person Election Day, curbside and provisional. At least a half dozen states — including Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Rhode Island, South Carolina and South Dakota — offer a similar menu of voting options as North Carolina, according to researchers for the U.S. Vote Foundation , a voter education nonprofit. But offering the most voting options doesn’t necessarily mean that a state offers the easiest ballot access, said Andrew Garber, counsel for the Brennan Center’s Voting Rights and Elections Program. ""It’s difficult to compare the number of ‘ways’ different states have to vote because the voting rules across states differ in many nuanced ways,"" Garber said in an email. ""A state that has a lot of ‘ways’ to vote may still not be that accessible for its voters."" For example, a state may have in-person early voting but limit voting hours or offer only a few voting sites. North Carolina’s same-day voting registration rules offer another example, Garber said. The state offers same-day registration — which lets eligible residents register to vote at an early voting site and vote the same day. But new laws enacted last year instruct election officials to scrap a voter’s ballot if the county’s address verification form is returned to the elections board as undeliverable. The law, which is being challenged in court, disqualifies ballots from registered voters ""even after they (present) photo ID and proof of residence"" at the polls, Garber said. Our ruling Ross said ""North Carolina has the longest voting period in the country … and we have the most ways of voting."" For general elections, that’s accurate. North Carolina is the only state that requires absentee ballots to be sent 60 days before Election Day. But this year, the state’s voting window for this year’s primary elections does not stand out. Ross’ claim about having the ""most ways"" of voting could also give North Carolinians the impression the state offers the easiest ballot access. That’s not necessarily the case as other states have similar offerings. Ross’ claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True. "

The X post shared a link to a Las Vegas Review-Journal article, and text with the article link said, ""Numerous Nevada voters looked at their voter history and found that their mail ballots were counted in the recent primary, even though they didn't participate in it."" (Screengrab from Instagram) The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. The full Review-Journal article explained that a database coding glitch occurred but did not affect election results. In Nevada, all voters receive mail ballots for each election they are qualified to participate in, unless a voter opts out. A majority of voters in Nevada cast ballots by mail. The Instagram post linked the recent Nevada database glitch to voter fraud, but Nevada election officials said the two are unrelated. ""I want to be clear that this issue had nothing to do with the tabulation of votes or results of any election,"" Secretary of State Francisco V. Aguilar, a Democrat, said in a Feb. 22 statement . ""There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in our state, now or ever."" Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, posted Feb. 19 on X, ""The voter history glitch on the website does not impact vote tabulation, which happens at the county level,"" and shared a link to an article with that information. Both the Instagram post and the X post it shared were from Sean Parnell , a former Pennsylvania U.S. Senate candidate who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump before dropping out in 2021. Parnell is a U.S. Army veteran who hosts a podcast . We asked Parnell to send us evidence that voter fraud occurred in Nevada. He replied in an email that the point of his Instagram post was that ""mail in voting is not the best way to conduct an election. It is also not the best way to build confidence in the electorate, the latest issue in Nevada is just one recent example."" (Parnell’s full response is linked at the end of this story.) Other people echoed Parnell’s claim. Elizabeth Helgelien, a Nevada Republican congressional candidate, said in a Feb. 18 X post that her online voter history showed she voted in the primary, although she did not. Helgelien said ""voter fraud"" appears to be happening in Nevada. Nevada secretary of state’s office said glitch occurred Nevada held its presidential preference primary Feb. 6. President Joe Biden won the Democratic primary while ""none of these candidates"" received the most votes in the Republican primary — more than former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Former President Donald Trump did not appear on the ballot because he competed in the caucus instead. About two weeks after the primary, voters notified the secretary of state’s office that, although they did not participate in the primary, the state’s website showed in their vote history that they had cast mail ballots. The secretary of state’s office said in a Feb. 21 memo that a miscommunication in computer code caused the glitch, ""based on the state and counties interpreting the same data in different ways."" Nevada has a ""bottom-up"" voter registration system in which counties send copies of their voter registration files to the state nightly via a secure upload. The state then stitches together 17 files from different systems and combines them into a statewide file. The counties use the mail ballot code ""MB."" Until the 10th day after an election, the state database interprets ""MB"" to mean that a mail ballot has been sent to a voter. After the 10th day, the system interprets the ""MB"" code to mean the mail ballot was counted. In prior elections, counties took steps to ensure that this code was applied only to ballots of people who had voted. But some of those steps did not happen after the Feb. 6 presidential preference primary, the memo said. The coding issue didn’t affect the election results, the memo said. Bottom-up systems have not been considered a best practice for decades, and the state will move to a new ""top-down"" system before this June’s primary election, in accordance with a 2021 law passed by the Legislature. Voter fraud occasionally occurs, but on a very small scale and not enough to change the outcome in a presidential election. After Biden won Nevada in the 2020 presidential election, the state’s Republican party shared a story about a Republican voter, Donald Kirk Hartle, who claimed someone cast a mail ballot in his dead wife’s name. Hartle himself later pleaded guilty to one count of voting more than once in an election, because he had cast the ballot in his dead wife’s name. The Heritage Foundation’s database of voter fraud shows only one other Nevada voter fraud conviction since 2020. Craig Frank was convicted in 2021 after voting in both Nevada and Arkansas during the 2016 general election. Parnell also sent us a 2012 New York Times article that said, ""While fraud in voting by mail is far less common than innocent errors, it is vastly more prevalent than the in-person voting fraud that has attracted far more attention, election administrators say."" The article included anecdotal examples including a woman in Hialeah, Florida, who was charged with forging an elderly voter’s signature and possessing 31 completed absentee ballots, more than allowed under local law. Election website glitches or clerical errors occasionally have happened in other jurisdictions. But these problems are typically from human error, and do not signal fraud. Instagram post cherry picks one sentence from 2005 report The Instagram post says that the ""Commission on Federal Election Reform, chaired by former President Jimmy Carter found vote by mail to be ‘the largest source of potential voter fraud.’"" Republican critics of voting by mail, including Trump , pluck one sentence from a 2005 report Carter co-wrote that said, ""absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud."" Although the nearly 20-year-old report generally communicated a dim view of absentee voting, it didn’t call for its elimination. Instead, it recommended ways to improve security and called for further research. Since then, security improvements have been implemented, including: Some states have passed laws to limit who can return a mail ballot on behalf of another voter. States have added technologies so voters can track their own mail ballots. Many states are part of a consortium to share voter registration data to flag outdated registrations, reducing the chance that a mail ballot is sent to someone who has died or who is no longer eligible to vote at that address. In 2020 and 2021, Carter defended the use of voting by mail. He said that given advances in the process, he believed it could be conducted ""in a manner that ensures election integrity."" Carter said he had cast mail ballots for years. Our ruling An Instagram post said a Nevada database glitch showing voters cast ballots when they didn’t is evidence that voting by mail is ""the largest source of potential voter fraud."" A database coding glitch issue meant that some Nevada voters saw an inaccurate vote history online — showing their mail ballots as counted even if the voters did not vote — after the Feb. 6 presidential preference primary. The Nevada secretary of state said the glitch was unconnected to vote tabulation and did not affect the election results. The post’s quote comes from a report Carter co-wrote in 2005 that highlighted mail voting’s vulnerabilities but did not call for its elimination. Since then, security improvements to voting by mail have been implemented. Carter has since said that voting-by-mail safeguards have advanced, that mail-in-voting can be done safely and that he votes by mail himself. We rate this statement False.

He was talking about Hovde Homes, a project from his company’s charitable foundation that builds shelters for vulnerable children across the world, including those who have been trafficked. There’s not much information available online about these shelters besides their locations — Guatemala and Honduras among them. Heartland Signal, too, seemed to recognize the mischaracterization. In a follow-up X post, they clarified he appeared to be talking about Hovde Homes.","Republican businessman Eric Hovde jumped in the race for one of Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate seats Tuesday, setting up a contest with U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, and prompting a wash of criticism of his background and motivations. One such criticism — from Heartland Signal, a digital newsroom anchored to a progressive Chicago radio station – lacked some key context. Heartland Signal shared a snippet of Hovde’s announcement event on X , in which the candidate spoke about the horrors of human trafficking. ""My brother and I have homes all over the world, and we have three in Central America, that deal with issues like this,"" Hovde said. In the post, Heartland Signal wrote that ""Eric Hovde says he understands the tragedy of children being trafficked through Central America because he owns three homes there."" That paints a bit of a misleading picture, especially given that Democrats and allies have portrayed Hovde as a carpetbagger, citing his owning residences in California and Washington, D.C . Let’s dive in. Hovde is referring to charitable shelters, not private homes Other X users, including Milwaukee Journal Sentinel state politics reporter Jessie Opoien , were quick to point out what Heartland Signal left out. The homes Hovde referenced are shelters financed by his company’s charitable giving foundation, not residences as the post suggests. According to the foundation’s website , Hovde ""has financed and oversees the construction and operation of Hovde Houses, which are homes that provide shelter, supportive services, education and love to vulnerable street children."" The website of Hovde’s company, Hovde Properties , describes them as providing ""shelter, care, education and love to vulnerable children that were abandoned on the street or trafficked."" It also refers to them as Hovde Homes. Hovde’s campaign website also mentions the shelters under a section titled ""Hovde’s Heart."" Twelve shelters have been completed to date in Bolivia, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, Kenya, Malawi, Mexico, Peru, Rwanda and Wisconsin, according to the site, and one is in progress in Costa Rica. Beyond the above, little information exists online about the shelters. A 2014 Wisconsin State Journal article says Hovde opened the first one in Mexico City in 2006, which had served more than 200 homeless children. Still, it’s clear that those were the homes he was referencing, not private homes. It appears that Heartland Signal, too, realized the distinction. ""While not mentioned in his speech, Hovde appears to be referring to his charitable foundation, Hovde Homes,"" they replied to the original X post. Our ruling Progressive outlet Heartland Signal claimed that ""Eric Hovde says he understands the tragedy of children being trafficked through Central America because he owns three homes there."" The homes he spoke of are shelters for vulnerable children, not residences. The original post left that distinction up to the public to suss out.

Learn more about PolitiFact’s fact-checking process and rating system.","Last week, after the chief executive of one of Nigeria’s largest banks died in a helicopter crash en route to the Super Bowl, social media users claimed that President Joe Biden planned the accident to destabilize the global economy and help him win the 2024 presidential election. In a Feb. 15 Instagram video , a woman says, ""I find it very weird that no one is talking about how there were six Nigerian billionaires who died in a plane crash mysteriously while on their way to the Super Bowl and how Biden just posted this cryptic a — message right after they died. Authorities are investigating it, which means to me they may suspect foul play."" The post’s caption says, ""This young woman is referring to the real meaning behind Joe Biden’s cryptic tweet after the Super Bowl."" In a Feb. 12 Instagram video , a man suggests that Biden orchestrated the accident to create a financial crisis leading up to the 2024 election, pointing to what he says are a series of similarities when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out before the 2020 election. Both posts refer to a Feb. 11 tweet from Biden’s official X account that shows the president with glowing red eyes and includes the caption, ""Just like we drew it up."" The image was a joke and referred to a conspiracy theory that the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl win was planned so Taylor Swift, the girlfriend of Chiefs player Travis Kelce, could endorse Biden for the 2024 presidency. Aviation experts told news outlets that poor weather — not Biden — likely was to blame for the fatal helicopter crash. The Associated Press reported that on Feb. 9, Herbert Wigwe, the CEO of Access Bank in Nigeria, his wife and son, two pilots and the former chair of the Nigerian stock exchange, died in a helicopter crash in Southern California’s Mojave Desert. The plane’s destination was Boulder City, Nevada, 26 miles southeast of Las Vegas, where Super Bowl LVIII was played Feb. 11. An accident investigation is ongoing, but aviation experts told AP that the flight should have been canceled because of poor nighttime weather conditions in the desert. A mix of rain and snow during the flight could have led to low visibility, and there are few lights in the Mojave Desert. ""If I were in charge, I certainly would have said ‘No, thank you’"" to flying, aviation safety consultant Pete Field told AP. Gary Hufbauer, a Peterson Institute for International Economics economist, said the claim that the helicopter accident was planned to create a global financial crisis is ""bizarre."" The Nigerian CEO’s death would not affect the global economy, he said. Wigwe and his associates were flying in a helicopter privately chartered by Orbic Air. Harvard University Risk and Audit Services found that flying on a chartered aircraft is more dangerous than flying on a commercial aircraft because charter operators are less regulated. In 2013, a lawsuit was filed against Orbic Air, claiming one of its helicopters was negligently operated after a man died in a crash, CBS reported at the time.

""I did nothing wrong, and I cooperated far more,"" Trump wrote in a Feb. 8 statement . It will be up to a jury to decide whether Trump did ""nothing wrong."" But his statement that he cooperated far more than Biden is absurd. Robert Hur, the special counsel who investigated Biden, summarized Trump’s lack of cooperation in a report about Biden’s case. ""Most notably, after being given multiple chances to return classified documents and avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite,"" Hur wrote . ""According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it. In contrast, Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations including his homes, sat for a voluntary interview and in other ways cooperated with the investigation."" Trump’s spokesperson did not respond to PolitiFact for this fact-check. Biden’s lawyers alerted federal officials to the documents A timeline of the Biden investigation that PolitiFact created based on news reports and statements by Biden lawyers showed that his lawyers quickly alerted federal officials after finding the documents. Biden also cooperated with federal law enforcement searches of his homes and offices. Nov. 2, 2022 : Biden’s lawyers discovered documents, some classified, in a locked closet at Biden’s post-vice presidential office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C. They found the documents while cleaning out the office. That same day , the White House Counsel’s Office notified the National Archives and Records Administration and the agency took the materials Nov. 3. Nov. 14, 2022 : Attorney General Merrick Garland directed John Lausch, a U.S. attorney in Chicago, to conduct an initial investigation. At some point in November 2022 : The FBI searched the Penn Biden Center with the Biden team’s consent, according to Jan. 31, 2023, news reports by CBS and other outlets that did not name sources. CNN reported that a search warrant was not used, which is a sign that Biden’s team cooperated. Dec. 20, 2022 : Biden’s personal attorneys searched his Wilmington, Delaware, home’s garage and found more records. The attorneys notified Lausch so the Justice Department could arrange to take the documents. Jan. 12, 2023 : Garland appointed Hur as special counsel. January and February 2023 : On Jan. 20, 2023, the FBI searched Biden’s Wilmington home and found more documents. A Feb. 1, 2023, search of Biden’s home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware turned up no classified documents. In a statement about the Feb. 1 search, Biden’s personal attorney Bob Bauer said that DOJ ""sought to do this work without advance public notice, and we agreed to cooperate."" Oct. 8-9, 2023 : Biden sat for a voluntary interview with Hur. The interview ""lasted more than five hours,"" Hur wrote , and Biden ""provided written answers to most of our additional written questions."" Court records show Trump failed to cooperate The Trump timeline ​​ we wrote based on news reports and court records of his charges showed that Trump tried to thwart federal officials. May 6, 2021 : National Archives and Records Administration’s chief counsel emailed Trump’s representatives seeking missing records, a search warrant showed . December 2021 : A search warrant stated that NARA continued to make requests of Trump representatives until late December, when the agency was advised that 12 boxes were ready for retrieval. January 2022 : The National Archives retrieved 15 boxes of records from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, Florida, home. The National Archives said Trump had ""torn up"" some of the presidential records. April 29 and May 1, 2022 : A lawyer wrote letters on Trump’s behalf requesting that the National Archives delay the disclosure to the FBI of the retrieved records. Acting archivist Debra Steidel Wall denied this request and stated that the boxes contained ""over 100 documents with classified markings, comprising 700 pages."" May 11, 2022 : Trump accepted a grand jury subpoena seeking classified documents. The indictment states that Trump told his attorney, ""I don’t want anybody looking through my boxes"" and ""What happens if we just don’t respond at all or don’t play ball with them?"" and ""Wouldn’t it be better if we just told them we don’t have anything here?"" Between May 23 and June 2, 2022 : At Trump’s direction, his personal aide Walter Nauta moved 64 boxes from a Mar-a-Lago storage room to Trump’s residence, according to the indictment . June 2, 2022 : A Trump attorney reviewed the documents in the Mar-a-Lago storage room and met with Trump. The attorney said that Trump made a plucking motion and told the attorney he should take the documents to his hotel room, and if there was anything ""really bad in there,"" pluck it out. June 3, 2022 : Justice Department officials briefly met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and retrieved more documents marked classified. A Trump lawyer signed a declaration saying that all the materials marked classified were turned over. But investigators later learned there were more records and that same month subpoenaed Trump again, seeking surveillance footage. Aug. 8, 2022 : The FBI, with a search warrant , searched Mar-a-Lago , removing 25 more boxes of documents. Days later, Garland said that the Justice Department had exhausted efforts to retrieve the material in other ways. ""Where possible, it is standard practice to seek less intrusive means as an alternative to a search, and to narrowly scope any search that is undertaken."" The indictment said that the search followed Trump’s refusal to cede records. Trump indictment details his lack of cooperation Trump was indicted in June 2023 on about three dozen counts , including charges of willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice, and making false statements. ""Trump endeavored to obstruct the FBI and the grand jury investigations and conceal his continued retention of classified documents,"" the indictment said. It said Trump did this by: ""Suggesting that his attorney falsely represent to the FBI and grand jury that Trump did not have the documents called for by the grand jury subpoena."" Directing Nauta ""to move boxes of documents to conceal them from Trump’s attorney, the FBI and the grand jury."" (Nauta was also charged.) ""Suggesting that his attorney hide or destroy documents"" called for by the subpoena. Giving the FBI and the grand jury some of the documents called for by the subpoena ""while claiming he was cooperating fully."" Causing the submission of a certification to the FBI and grand jury ""falsely representing"" that all documents had been produced. Our ruling Comparing himself with Biden, Trump said, ""I cooperated far more"" in his classified documents investigation. Government records rebut his statement. Biden lawyers alerted federal officials on the same day they found the documents, and Biden cooperated with searches and sat for an interview for the special counsel’s investigation. Trump’s indictment shows he failed to cooperate on multiple occasions. He refused to return documents for months and enlisted others to hide or destroy evidence. Trump once asked his attorney, according to the indictment, ""Wouldn’t it be better if we just told them we don’t have anything here?"" His lack of cooperation culminated in an FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022. It’s ridiculous for Trump to state that he cooperated more than Biden. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

On his first day as president, Joe Biden asked Congress to create a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. But the current Senate bill, which Biden supports, would not do that. There is no guarantee that immigrants who become citizens will vote for Democrats. Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy. Learn more.","Days before senators unveiled a immigration bill aimed at slowing illegal immigration, Elon Musk riffed on a common myth that Democrats want mass illegal immigration to gain more voters. ""Biden’s strategy is very simple: 1. Get as many illegals in the country as possible. 2. Legalize them to create a permanent majority – a one-party state,"" Musk posted Feb. 2 on X . ""That is why they are encouraging so much illegal immigration. Simple, yet effective."" Over one week, Musk posted about immigration about two dozen times; another post said that "" every deportation is a lost vote. "" The morning after a trio of bipartisan senators unveiled the immigration bill, Musk wrote , ""The long-term goal of the so-called ‘Border Security’ bill is enabling illegals to vote! It will do the total opposite of securing the border."" Musk’s statement echoes a recent statement by former President Donald Trump, who said, ""That’s why they are allowing these people to come in — people that don’t speak our language — they are signing them up to vote."" We rated that Pants on Fire . Such statements align with conspiracy theories about the "" great replacement ,"" which claim white people of European descent are deliberately being replaced with nonwhite people. Musk provided no evidence to show such a Biden strategy exists. And the claim doesn’t add up, because it takes immigrants years to become U.S. citizens, and there’s no guarantee that immigrants who gain citizenship will vote for Democrats. We emailed the X press account and received an automatic reply saying, ""busy now, please check back later."" It takes many years for immigrants to become voting citizens Musk called this alleged strategy ""very simple"" and ""effective,"" but it’s neither. Federal law requires citizenship as a condition to vote in national elections. Gaining citizenship can take a decade or longer. Interacting with the government, including trying to vote, is something immigrants in the country illegally try to avoid, Mike Madrid, a Republican strategist, previously told PolitiFact : ""They are not going to go register to vote and expose themselves."" Occasionally, noncitizens have been prosecuted for voting . When noncitizens register to vote, it is often in error. Biden supports new Senate bill that doesn’t have path to citizenship Musk’s X post included a screenshot of a January 2021 Associated Press article about Biden’s plan to ask Congress to create a path for citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. But Biden’s efforts stalled because his proposed 2021 bill did not advance. Biden has said if it passes, he will sign the new Senate legislation that is considerably tougher on immigration. If fully implemented, the proposed legislation would decrease the number of immigrants permitted into the country because of its higher standard to be considered for asylum. It’s unclear whether the bill has the votes to pass the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said it is dead on arrival. Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson for the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said the new legislation ""does not provide any path to citizenship for anyone currently in the country illegally and would not in any way expedite legal permanent residence for any future border arrivals."" ""It takes on average 5 years in green card status before a person can become a U.S. citizen, so no one would instantly gain the right to vote,"" Mittelstadt said. And there is no guarantee that immigrants who become citizens will vote for Democrats. Experts have told us it’s ridiculous to make assumptions about how immigrants crossing the border now will vote in the future if they gain citizenship. Musk’s comments spread misinformation about elections Since Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, the platform now known as X has removed guardrails designed to restrict the flow of mis- and disinformation. It’s easy to discount such ""conspiracy theory nonsense"" from random trolls on X, but it’s powerful when it comes from Musk who owns the platform, said Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of Common Cause Texas, a group that advocates for voting rights. Democracies require participation, and falsehoods ""only increase the likelihood that people will lose faith in our elections and simply opt out,"" Gutierrez said. Our ruling Musk said Biden’s strategy is to ""get as many illegals in the country as possible"" and ""legalize them to create a permanent majority."" The path to U.S. citizenship, which is required for voting in federal elections, can take a decade, so the current influx of immigrants would not lead to a significant number of new voters for many years, if ever. Even when immigrants become voting citizens, it doesn’t mean the United States will become a one-party nation.

"February 6, 2024",Instagram posts,"""Last time Democrats removed a Republican from the ballot” was Abraham Lincoln in 1860.",false,"Former President Donald Trump’s inclusion on Republican primary ballots has been formally challenged in 35 states. Challengers have cited the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, Section 3, which prohibits anyone who engaged in insurrection from holding the office of president. President Abraham Lincoln was not removed from general election ballots in 1860. At that time, political parties distributed their own ballots, which were single-party tickets, and some slaveholding states in the South did not print and hand out Republican ballots because there was little support for Lincoln in those places. Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy. Learn more.","Days before the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear former President Donald Trump’s appeal of his removal from Colorado’s March 5 Republican primary ballot, social media users compared his electoral plight with Abraham Lincoln’s in 1860. A Jan. 26 Instagram post reshared a video in which a man describes efforts to remove Trump from the ballot. The man compared the situation with the 1860 election, and said President Abraham Lincoln was removed from ballots. ""The last time Democrats removed a Republican from the ballot was 1860,"" he said. ""That candidate was Abraham Lincoln. He still went on to win, and the Civil War started the next year. He also won that."" He claimed that Trump was being removed from the ballot ""for saying the elections were rigged."" The video was originally shared by its creator in a Dec. 20, 2023, Instagram post that garnered more than 150,000 likes. We have seen numerous similar claims in recent months, comparing efforts to remove Trump from ballots with Lincoln’s 1860 election. Many said that Lincoln was removed from ballots in 10 slaveholding states. One TikTok video shared a video of Fox News host and commentator Jesse Watters making the false claim on his show . The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Like the Instagram video’s claim, the posts are wrong about why some are seeking to remove Trump from the primary ballot in dozens of states, and about Lincoln’s ballot status in 1860. Trump ballot challenges Formal challenges to Trump’s inclusion on Republican primary ballots have been made in at least 35 states, according to a New York Times review . Of those, only Colorado and Maine have taken steps to remove Trump from their state’s ballot, although those cases are being challenged in court. As of Feb. 3, 17 states have rejected efforts to remove Trump from the ballot, and cases in 16 states are unresolved, the Times said. The challenges are not for simply questioning the election results, as the Instagram video says, but over Trump’s actions on or before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump was ineligible for the White House and should be removed from the state’s Republican March 5 primary ballot based on the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, Section 3 , which says that no person who has ""engaged in insurrection"" can hold the office of president. The Colorado lawsuit was filed by a group of Republican and independent voters . The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments in the case Feb. 8, and a decision will likely impact challenges to Trump’s candidacy in other states. On Dec. 28, Maine Secretary of State ​​Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, unilaterally removed Trump from the Republican primary ballot after three challenges by voters, also citing the 14th Amendment’s insurrection clause. Trump has appealed that decision to a Maine Superior Court. Was Lincoln removed from ballots in 1860? Historians told PolitiFact that the claim comparing Trump’s ballot removals to the Lincoln era shows a misunderstanding about how general elections worked in the 1800s. (Primary elections didn’t come into general use in the U.S. until the early 20th century .) Jonathan W. White, a Christopher Newport University American studies professor, said in the mid-19th century, political parties were responsible for printing and distributing their own ballots to supporters. Other experts said because there was little support for Lincoln in slaveholding Southern states, the Republican Party didn’t waste resources printing and handing out ballots there. ""To be fair to the gentleman in the video, I've heard professional historians make the mistake of saying that ‘Lincoln wasn't on the ballot.’ The truth is that nobody banned him,"" White said. ""It's just that there weren't any Republican Party organizations, or voters, in most of the South, which meant that there wouldn't be any Republican ballots for Lincoln to be on."" Cecily Zander, a Texas Woman’s University assistant history professor, said after being ""frustrated"" by the ""erroneous"" comparison, she wrote a blog post about it on Emerging Civil War, a website that shares scholarly articles about the Civil War. Voters in Lincoln’s 1860 election would have submitted a ""party ticket"" — supplied by their party — in the ballot box at their polling place, Zander wrote. That ticket wouldn’t include candidates from opposing parties, only the candidates for one party. Because the Republican party didn’t expect a large number of votes in places such as Alabama or Mississippi, which at the time were majority Democratic, it didn’t distribute tickets in those states, she wrote. ""It was a waste of time and resources to send thousands of Lincoln ballots to the South, just to have them sit in unopened boxes on Election Day,"" Zander wrote. She shared an image of an 1860 Republican ticket in Iowa in her post, and more examples can be seen on this National Museum of American History webpage . Louis Masur, a Rutgers University American studies and history professor, said Democrats didn’t remove Lincoln from ballots. He didn’t appear because the Republican party ""in effect, did not exist in those states."" Our ruling A man in an Instagram video said, ""Last time Democrats removed a Republican from the ballot"" was Lincoln in 1860. Comparisons with Lincoln’s 1860 election ignore the differences between elections then and now, historians said. Political parties were responsible for providing single-party tickets to voters; Republicans had little support in the South, so chose not to distribute tickets in some states. No ballot featured candidates from multiple parties, like those used in today’s general elections, so Lincoln could not have been removed from one. The claim is False. "

Other Republican presidential nominees accomplished this feat in 2004, 2008 and 2012. The two times Ronald Reagan was on the ballot, he won 58 and 74 counties in Oklahoma.","There’s little doubt that former President Donald Trump has been popular in Oklahoma: In 2016 and 2020, Trump won more than 65% of the votes cast in the Sooner State. But did he set a record by winning all 77 counties? That’s what Trump told conservative radio host Dan Bongino in a recent interview. The topic arose Feb. 5 because of Trump’s opposition to a bipartisan immigration legislation crafted in the Senate. Trump has assailed the proposal as a ""betrayal of America."" And he told Republican senators to ""blame it on me"" if they get criticism from their constituents for voting it down the measure, which had a Republican from Oklahoma, Sen. James Lankford, among its leading negotiators. Calling in to Bongino’s show , Trump said he ""did not endorse"" Lankford ( which is false ; Trump endorsed him in 2022). In Oklahoma, he said, ""I won 77 out of 77 counties. Ronald Reagan is second with 56."" Although Trump did win every Oklahoma county, he is far from the first to do so. ""Not a single county in Oklahoma has voted Democratic in a presidential election since 2000 — a 385-for-385 record for the GOP,"" wrote the Almanac of American Politics 2024 , a biennial reference book. (The author of this article is a senior author of the Almanac.) The Republican presidential nominees in 2004 (George W. Bush), 2008 (John McCain) and 2012 (Mitt Romney) preceded Trump in winning all 77 counties in Oklahoma. The last Democrat to win any Oklahoma county was Al Gore, who ran against George W. Bush in 2000. Gore won nine counties, mostly in the eastern part of the state; these counties were ancestrally Democratic but like many other rural parts of the U.S. increasingly shifted allegiance to the GOP. Reagan also did better than Trump said he did. In 1980, he won 58 Oklahoma counties, and in 1984, he won 74. In 2020, Oklahoma was one of only two states in which Trump swept every county; West Virginia was the other. Trump came close to sweeping a few other states: Kentucky, where he won all but two of 120 counties; Indiana, where he won all but five of 92 counties; and Tennessee, where he won all but three of 95 counties. Our ruling Trump said that in Oklahoma, ""I won 77 out of 77 counties. Ronald Reagan is second with 56.""

"February 5, 2024",Nikki Haley,"If Texas says, “‘We don’t want to be part of America anymore’ … that’s their decision to make.”",false,"Constitutional law experts said the Civil War settled the issue of whether states can secede from the U.S. They cannot. A Supreme Court ruling after the war affirmed that the U.S. is ""an indestructible union"" and states do not have the right to unilaterally secede. Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy. Learn more.","Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley recently said she believes that states should have the right to do what their residents want to do — even if that means seceding from the United States. In a Jan. 31 episode of ""The Breakfast Club"" radio show, host Charlamagne tha God asked Haley about Texas’ border dispute with the federal government and whether she still believes states have the right to secede, pointing to her previous remarks on the subject. On the radio show, Haley acknowledged that Texas is not going to secede, but said, ""If Texas decides they want to do that, they can do that. … If that whole state says, ‘We don’t want to be part of America anymore,’ I mean, that’s their decision to make."" Haley later walked back her comments in a Feb. 4 CNN interview , saying the Constitution doesn’t allow states to secede. Haley’s campaign did not answer PolitiFact’s request for comment. ""What I do think they have the right to do is have the power to protect themselves and do all that,"" Haley said on CNN. ""Texas has talked about seceding for a long time. The Constitution doesn’t allow for that. But what I will say is … where’s that coming from? That’s coming from the fact that people don’t think that (the) government is listening to them."" For months, Texas and the federal government have been locked in a tense standoff over border security measures as record numbers of migrants illegally cross into the U.S. from Mexico. Meanwhile, social media has been awash with claims about Texas seceding and warnings of an impending civil war . ""Texas is about to become its own country to stop a civil war from occurring,"" a Jan. 30 Instagram post claimed. To address Haley’s initial comment and the internet buzz, we asked constitutional law experts whether a state could secede from the U.S. The consensus was a resounding ""no."" Experts said the Civil War tested and settled this question 159 years ago, and Haley’s radio show remarks ignored this significant part of American history. It wasn’t the first time Haley, a former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador, had misrepresented Civil War history. The Constitution does not say anything explicitly for or against secession, experts said. ""But it’s pretty significant evidence that during the debates over ratification, when states were deciding whether or not to join this new union, no one said, ‘Well, if you don’t like it, you can always leave,’"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. Roosevelt said if Haley was making a moral or political argument, she could appeal to the Declaration of Independence as the 11 seceding southern states did at the time of the Civil War. ""But that’s not the Constitution, and the aspect of the Declaration that we consider foundational to America now is more ‘all men are created equal’ than ‘it is the right of the people to alter or abolish’ their government,"" Roosevelt said. ""So Haley is offering a Confederate view of the Constitution that cost us over half a million lives."" After the Civil War, in 1869, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Texas v. White that the U.S. is ""an indestructible union"" and states do not have the right to unilaterally secede. ""When Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation,"" the ruling stated . ""There was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States."" The late conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia also weighed in on secession’s legality: ""If there was any constitutional issue resolved by the Civil War, it is that there is no right to secede,"" Scalia wrote in a 2006 letter. If Texas or another state wanted to secede and the state reached an agreement via Congress with the rest of the country, then it might work, said Brian Kalt, a Michigan State University law professor. However, it’s more likely a secession attempt ""would constitute an insurrection against the United States that the central government would be entirely justified in suppressing by armed force, just as Lincoln did the Confederacy,"" said Frank Bowman, a University of Missouri law professor. Our ruling Haley said, ""If that whole state says, ‘We don’t want to be part of America anymore,’ I mean, that’s their decision to make."" Constitutional law experts told us the Civil War’s outcome and Supreme Court precedent say the opposite. We rate Haley’s claim False.  "

Some states loosened restrictions that required voters to provide excuses for using mail ballots. Other states sent mail ballots or mail ballot applications to all registered voters.

""They used COVID to cheat and they did a lot of other things, too,"" Trump said during his Jan. 23 victory speech in Nashua, urging his supporters to ""never forget history"" We’ve heard him say it before, including in October 2021 , in May 2022 , and along the campaign trail in April . ""Democrats used COVID to cheat,"" he said during a July 2021 Florida rally . ""They illegally changed the rules in the key states and mailed out millions and millions of absentee ballots all over."" We asked Trump campaign spokespeople for Trump’s evidence and received no reply. PolitiFact has repeatedly rated claims that the 2020 election was rigged or that Joe Biden was illegitimately elected Pants on Fire . Trump is also wrong to state that Democrats used COVID-19 to ""cheat."" Although many states made changes to increase access to voting by mail, that was not a Democratic plot. In Kentucky, the Republican secretary of state and Democratic governor, using powers granted by the Republican-controlled General Assembly, authorized no-excuse mail-in voting and no-excuse early voting in 2020, said Republican Trey Grayson, a former Kentucky secretary of state. ""Changing election laws or policies to successfully conduct an election in the middle of a pandemic when those changes are authorized by law is not cheating,"" Grayson said. ""Cheating would be doing so without any authorization."" Many states changed election procedures due to pandemic Trump’s comments appear to allude to states’ changing procedures in 2020 to ease voting by mail during the pandemic, when in-person gatherings appeared to raise the risk of viral spread. The National Conference of State Legislatures cited many examples including: Relaxed excuses to vote absentee : In January 2020, 16 states required voters to identify a reason for requesting an absentee ballot. Before the 2020 general election, 14 of the 16 states changed their requirements for getting an absentee ballot. They included Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia. Mostly mail-elections : In January 2020, five states used mostly-mail elections: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington. Before November 2020, California, Vermont and the District of Columbia temporarily joined this group. Nevada passed Assembly Bill 4 , which stated that, under a state of emergency, all active registered voters would be sent a mail ballot, and made that permanent the next year. Mailing ballot applications to all voters : In January 2020, no states had policies to mail applications for absentee ballots or mail ballots to all registered voters. In time for the 2020 general election, 12 states temporarily changed their policies and mailed ballot applications to all registered voters. They included Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, Rhode Island and Wisconsin. New Mexico passed a bill that left this decision to each county clerk. Drop boxes : In January 2020, just eight states had statutes authorizing the use of ballot drop boxes or set minimum standards for operations. For the 2020 general election, drop boxes were used statewide or in some cities or counties in 40 states and Washington, D.C., according to the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project . The changes came about through legislative actions, executive orders and administrative decisions by state and local officials, said Rachel Orey, an elections expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Under no standard definition did this qualify as cheating. Many states — red, blue and battleground — aimed to make voting by mail easier so voters concerned about COVID-19 could avoid voting indoors. Voters of both major parties and independents could vote under the new mail ballot rules. Many key battleground states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, already had no-excuse absentee voting before the pandemic. Some courts did rule against enacted or planned election administration decisions, including policies related to checking signatures in Michigan , curbside voting in Alabama and absentee ballot deadlines in Minnesota . But those rulings don’t signal cheating, either. ""Cheating is fraud, like stuffing a ballot box or altering vote totals,"" said Edward B. Foley, director of Election Law at Ohio State University. ""Even if changing the rules for return of absentee ballots was an impermissible change, it was pursuant to a legal process (the rule of law), above board, and not a denial of the electorate’s preference by fabricating a different outcome than what the voters wanted."" These election procedure changes were executed as part of authorized public processes. In New Hampshire, the state’s attorney general and secretary of state in written guidance , and later lawmakers through legislation, said COVID-19 was an excuse to vote by mail in 2020. ""This clearly was not cheating and was legal and resulted in a strong but not unusual turnout notwithstanding the pandemic,"" said Bradford E. Cook, a Republican, lawyer and chair of the state’s Ballot Law Commission. Sporadic cases of voter fraud have been uncovered since the election, including a small number of people who cast mail ballots in dead relatives’ names. But these accounted for a minuscule percentage of votes cast and would not have changed Trump’s loss. The 2020 election outcome was verified in many ways. States certified the results. Congress accepted the results. Trump and his allies lost in court more than 60 times . Republicans have laid the groundwork for election challenges in 2024. The Republican National Committee in 2021 launched a Committee on Election Integrity and later an Election Integrity Department . It participated in nearly 100 lawsuits during the midterms and is recruiting thousands of poll workers in preparation for November. Our ruling Trump said Democrats ""used COVID to cheat"" in the 2020 election. Trump didn’t elaborate. But in similar remarks in 2021, he mentioned states mailing out ballots. Many states made voting easier during the pandemic by mailing a ballot or an application to receive a ballot to registered voters. Some states that previously required voters to have an excuse to vote by mail loosened that rule. Trump is free to disagree with these changes, but he is wrong — and ridiculously so — to characterize them as cheating. These changes were made openly, through executive orders, administrative actions or law. And when a state expanded access to voting by mail, that was available to Republican voters, too.

This was because of a disagreement between the state and national party after the Democratic National Committee reordered the primary schedule to make South Carolina the first primary state instead of New Hampshire. New Hampshire state law dictates that its primary must be first in the nation , so the state went ahead with its Jan. 23 primary, despite the DNC’s change. As a result, no Democratic delegates from the state will be awarded at the convention later this year. Because of the change, Biden did not campaign in New Hampshire, leading his supporters to organize a write-in campaign on his behalf. Write-in votes can take longer to be reported because they must be hand-counted . Many precincts prepared for the large number of write-in ballots from Biden supporters. Because of this, the secretary of state and attorney general said in January that ""to the extent that counting the write-in votes takes longer than expected, the moderator may release the Republican results earlier than the Democratic results provided the results are complete.""

"January 26, 2024",Cindi Duchow,"""Unfortunately during COVID, the clerks in Madison and Milwaukee told their constituents that they were actually indefinitely confined and did not have to come and vote, which was incorrect.""",mostly-true,"The Wisconsin Supreme Court blocked Dane County's clerk from telling groups of voters they could request absentee ballots without showing a photo ID because of the coronavirus pandemic. Milwaukee County’s clerk issued guidance nearly identical to that of the Dane County clerk. Following clarifying guidance issued by the Wisconsin Elections Commission, the Milwaukee clerk issued an updated statement that emphasized adherence to the commission’s guidance. The clerks’ guidance was in reference to requesting absentee ballots and photo IDs. The clerks’ guidance did not address whether voters ""did not have to come and vote.""","By early 2020, COVID-19 was sweeping through the United States and began wreaking havoc on the daily lives of millions of Americans. Confusion over voting and the polls swirled around the April 7, 2020, election. On the ballot was the presidential primary and elections for state Supreme Court, Milwaukee mayor, Milwaukee County executive and other local offices. With regular polling places drastically reduced in many cities, many voters cast their ballots by alternative means, with county officials in Dane and Milwaukee offering guidance to voters, specifically on what they needed to do to get an absentee ballot. ""Unfortunately during COVID, the clerks in Madison and Milwaukee told their constituents that they were actually indefinitely confined and did not have to come and vote, which was incorrect,"" state Rep. Cindi Duchow, R-Town of Delafield, said Nov. 9, 2023, during an Assembly floor session in which she spoke in favor of Assembly Bill 494 . One of the provisions of A.B. 494, introduced Oct. 16, 2023 , by Duchow and other lawmakers, states that a voter seeking indefinitely confined status must apply for that status on an application prescribed by the Elections Commission. Also under the bill, an outbreak or epidemic of a communicable disease in a voter's community does not qualify the voter as indefinitely confined. So, did the clerks in Dane and Milwaukee Counties tell their constituents that they were actually indefinitely confined and did not have to come and vote and was the advice from the clerks off-base on what voters needed to do to obtain an absentee ballot? Let’s take a look. The Supreme Court ruling When asked for backup for the claim, Duchow, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, said AB 494 is designed to ""ensure that voters clearly understand when they can declare themselves ‘indefinitely confined,’ and do not rely on election misinformation from left-wing clerks."" Duchow said in preparing the measure, she reviewed several sources, including the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s decision in Republican Party of Wisconsin v. Dane County. As reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the court on March 31, 2020, blocked Dane County's clerk from telling voters they could request absentee ballots without showing a photo ID because of the coronavirus pandemic. According to ruling , Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell, on March 25, 2020, posted the following guidance to voters on his Facebook page: ""I have informed Dane County Municipal Clerks that during this emergency and based on the Governors Stay at Home order I am declaring all Dane County voters may indicate as needed that they are indefinitely confined due to illness. This declaration will make it easier for Dane County voters to participate in this election by mail in these difficult times. I urge all voters who request a ballot and have trouble presenting a valid ID to indicate that they are indefinitely confined. ""A voter can select a box that reads ‘I certify that I am indefinitely confined due to age, illness, infirmity or disability and request ballots be sent to me for every election until I am no longer confined or fail to return a ballot.’ The voter is then able to skip the step of uploading an ID in order to receive a ballot for the April 7 election."" The Milwaukee County Clerk, George Christenson, issued a nearly identical declaration on Facebook later that same day, the high court ruling said. The Milwaukee County Clerk ""urged all voters who request a ballot and do not have the ability or equipment to upload a valid ID to indicate that they are indefinitely confined,"" the Supreme Court ruling said. McDonell, the Journal Sentinel reported, said he was not trying to circumvent the voter ID law, but wanted to alert voters that those who are confined can get absentee ballots without an ID. Christenson, as the Journal Sentinel reported, wrote in a letter that he had informed the county’s municipal clerks that this is an appropriate course of action during Gov. Tony Evers’ stay-at-home order and the Wisconsin Elections Commission’s guidance. The Journal Sentinel reported that the justices ruled all voters could not be considered confined just because Evers ordered people to stay at home except when they are conducting essential business ""McDonell appeared to assert that all voters are automatically, indefinitely confined solely due to the emergency and the Safer at Home Order and that voters could therefore declare themselves to be indefinitely confined when requesting an absentee ballot, which would allow them to skip the step of presenting or uploading a valid proof of identification,"" the justices wrote. What the clerks say In Dane County, McDonell, in an email, acknowledged the court action. ""The state supreme court affirmed in 2020 that under state law individual voters, not clerks or lawmakers, determine whether they are indefinitely confined due to illness or age,"" McDonell said. ""During the pandemic, many voters around the state temporarily determined they were indefinitely confined due to the COVID virus. Nothing has changed and that is still the law today."" In Milwaukee County, Christenson said Duchow’s statement ""isn't accurate"" and pointed to an updated statement his office issued following clarified guidance issued by the Wisconsin Election Commission on March 27, 2020. That guidance said, partly, that voters must decide for themselves whether they qualify for the ‘indefinitely confined’ photo identification exception based upon their current circumstances. Also, according to the WEC guidance, ""indefinitely confined status shall not be used by electors simply as a means to avoid the photo identification requirement."" Christenson said his office followed the science around COVID-19 and adhered to the law. ""This measure not only aligned with public health considerations at the time, but also ensured the preservation of the fundamental right to vote for all eligible individuals. We followed the science, we followed the law, and I would make the same decision today."" The court ruling , in fact, says the clerk guidance on how to obtain an absentee ballot was ""erroneous"": ""Accordingly, we conclude that the Respondents' interpretation of Wisconsin election laws was erroneous. Additionally, we conclude that Emergency Order (No.) 12 did not render all Wisconsin electors ‘indefinitely confined,’ thereby obviating the requirement of a valid photo identification to obtain an absentee ballot."" Legal expert weighs in Rick Esenberg, president and general counsel for Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, a nonprofit conservative law firm, pointed out in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin that the clerks’ initial guidance said people were confined because of the pandemic, and the Milwaukee clerk added an additional statement that ""urged all voters who request a ballot and do not have the ability or equipment to upload a valid ID to indicate that they are indefinitely confined."" Esenberg said the clarified guidance issued by the Wisconsin Elections Commission didn’t address the COVID-19 issue directly but said an elector couldn’t claim indefinitely confined status to avoid uploading a photo ID to obtain a ballot. After oral arguments, Esenberg said, the Supreme Court enjoined the clerks from giving advice contrary to the commission’s guidelines. ""After the election, it reached the issue on the merits and said the clerks were wrong, WEC was right and that a voter couldn’t claim to be indefinitely confined because of the condition of another, i.e., couldn’t claim to be confined because others were sick and he or she was afraid of becoming infected,"" Esenberg said. ""In its view, the statutory language just doesn’t say that. It did say, however, that whether someone was indefinitely confined was a determination to be made by the voter."" So, the clerks were wrong according to the court, Esenberg explained, but there is a major caveat to Duchow’s statement. ""The issue wasn’t really ‘coming to vote’ if, by that, we mean voting in person. It was what you have to do to get an absentee ballot,"" Esenberg said. Our ruling Duchow said, ""Unfortunately during COVID, the clerks in Madison and Milwaukee told their constituents that they were actually indefinitely confined and did not have to come and vote, which was incorrect."" Although it’s true that clerks in Dane and Milwaukee Counties offered incorrect guidance to voters, Duchow’s claim mischaracterizes what the clerks’ posts said with the phrase ""did not have to come and vote."" According to the Supreme Court ruling, the clerks’ guidance did not refer to not coming in to vote. Rather, the clerks were offering advice to voters on indicating, as needed, that they are indefinitely confined because of illness when requesting an absentee ballot, which would allow them to skip the step of presenting or uploading a valid proof of identification, as the Supreme Court justices noted. When a statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, the rating is Mostly True, and that fits here. "

Here's how we do it .","""What a bunch of malarkey!"" begins a robocall to New Hampshire voters that sounds like the voice of President Joe Biden. But the entire call can be summed up with one of Biden’s often repeated words: malarkey. The robocall sent two days before the New Hampshire primary is fabricated. Biden did not record the call, his campaign confirmed. ""We know the value of voting Democratic when our votes count,"" says the recording, obtained by NBC News . ""It’s important that you save your vote for the November election. We will need your help in electing Democrats up and down the ticket. Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday."" The recording included a phone number people could call if they wanted to be removed from the call list. That number was the cellphone of Kathleen Sullivan, a former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair. Sullivan is the treasurer of Granite for America , a political action committee encouraging Democrats to write in Biden’s name on the New Hampshire ballot. Sullivan told PolitiFact that on Jan. 21 — two days before the primary — she received about a dozen calls from phone numbers she didn’t recognize. Sullivan said she spoke to one of the callers and the person told her about receiving the robocall. Sullivan contacted the state attorney general and filed a complaint Jan. 22. The attorney general’s office issued a statement the same day announcing that it is investigating the call, which it said was ""artificially generated based on initial indications."" The press release said the calls ""appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters,"" and instructed voters to disregard the call’s message. The press release said voting in the primary does not mean a voter cannot vote in the general election. In New Hampshire, it is a felony to knowingly use fraudulent or misleading information to deter or prevent someone from voting. ""Spreading disinformation to suppress voting and deliberately undermine free and fair elections will not stand, and fighting back against any attempt to undermine our democracy will continue to be a top priority for this campaign,"" Biden-Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. The attorney general encouraged people who received the robocall to email the Justice Department’s Election Law Unit ( [email protected] ) and provide the date and time of the call and any other relevant information. Biden’s name will not be on the primary ballot because the Democratic National Committee decided that in 2024 South Carolina would, for the first time, hold the first primary. Not only has New Hampshire traditionally had that first-in-the-nation spot on the primary calendar, but there is also a New Hampshire law requiring the state to set its primary first. Ultimately, New Hampshire law required that a Democratic primary be held Jan. 23, but the party will not use it to allocate the state’s delegates for the presidential nomination. Ahead of the 2024 elections, an expert told PolitiFact that deepfakes, generated images and voice cloning could be used to imitate political candidates and target other politicians, voters and poll workers. Experts have also warned that foreign adversaries can use new generative artificial intelligence tools to conduct influence operations more efficiently and effectively.

In one example, bright red text overlaid on a Dec. 18 Instagram video claimed, ""Illegal immigrants now have the right to vote in New York."" The video featured a Dec. 5 House Homeland Security Committee hearing and tied the claim to a New York City voting law. ""Mr. Blakeman, let me ask you a question,"" Rep. Josh Brecheen, R-Okla., said during the hearing. ""Can illegal immigrants in New York vote?"" Bruce Blakeman, county executive for Nassau County, New York, responded: ""In New York City, I believe they passed a law. Luckily, we don’t have that law in Nassau County. But in the city council and mayoral races, I believe illegal aliens recently have been given the right to vote."" This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Screenshot from Instagram.) Blakeman’s comments in the clip misrepresented a New York City law that allowed noncitizens in the U.S. legally to vote in some municipal elections. The post’s claim that immigrants in the country illegally can vote in New York is wrong. ""There is no law allowing noncitizens to vote statewide in New York"" or any other state, said Joshua Douglas, a professor at the University of Kentucky’s J. David Rosenberg College of Law who researches election law and voting rights. Only citizens are permitted to vote in New York statewide elections Under federal law, only U.S. citizens may vote in national elections. Susan Lerner, the executive director of the voting rights group Common Cause New York, said that only U.S. citizens can vote in New York state. In 2021, New York City lawmakers approved legislation that allowed about 800,000 noncitizen New York residents to vote in municipal elections, assuming they had lived in the city for 30 days and were legal permanent residents of the U.S. or had work authorization. This appears to be the law Blakeman referred to during the hearing . The legislation neither allowed noncitizens to vote in statewide or federal elections, nor extended voting rights to immigrants in the country illegally. ""Permanent residents and people authorized to work here are documented and approved by the federal government,"" Lerner said. ""They pay state and federal taxes, and pay into Social Security as well. In many cases, they’ve lived in the United States for decades. There is nothing ‘illegal’ about them."" The measure never took hold. In June 2022, before the law could even take effect, a New York judge struck it down for violating the state constitution, which says that ""every citizen"" is entitled to vote. That decision is being appealed. Oral arguments were held in June , but no decision has been handed down. ""Even if the appeals court rules in favor of the city, allowing (New York City) to implement the law, again, it would only allow legal residents who are not U.S. citizens"" to vote, said Ron Hayduk, a political science professor at San Francisco State University. It would not grant the right to vote to immigrants in New York illegally, as the post suggested. Across the U.S., more than a dozen cities have taken steps to allow noncitizens to vote in some local elections, including some cities in California, Maryland and Vermont, Hayduk said. Noncitizen voting in elections is generally limited to municipal elections and is not widespread, however. Furthermore, fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens is rare and usually occurs as a result of a misunderstanding or mistake, such as a noncitizen accidentally registering to vote when applying for a driver’s license. Our ruling A video post claimed, ""Illegal immigrants now have the right to vote in New York."" Only U.S. citizens can vote in statewide and national elections in New York. A 2021 law in New York City allowed about 800,000 noncitizens the right to vote in local elections, but a judge struck down that law in 2022 and it’s not in effect.

Ted Cruz of Texas finished first in the Iowa caucus with about 27.6% of the vote. Trump finished second with 24.3% and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida finished third with 23.1%. Headed into the caucus, Trump was ahead of Cruz in the polls. Initially, Trump congratulated Cruz. ""We finished second,"" he said in a speech after the caucus . ""And I want to tell you something, I’m just honored. I’m really honored. And I want to congratulate Ted (Cruz)."" But two days later, Trump tweeted several times , blaming Cruz’s win on fraud. In one tweet, Trump wrote , ""Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified."" In another : ""Cruz did not win Iowa, he stole it."" Trump’s claims followed reports that Cruz supporters spread false rumors that a third candidate, Dr. Ben Carson, had suspended his campaign amid voting. Iowa Rep. Steve King, a national co-chairman of Cruz’s campaign, wrote on Twitter the evening of the caucus: ""Looks like (Carson) is out. ... Skipping NH & SC is the equivalent of suspending. Too bad this information won’t get to all caucus goers."" Carson, who would later serve as Housing and Urban Development secretary under Trump, called the comments ""dirty tricks"" and Cruz apologized, calling it a ""mistake."" When Cruz was asked in 2016 about Trump’s comments in a New Hampshire news conference, Cruz said Trump was someone who ""finds it very hard to lose."" When Trump loses, ""he blames everybody else. It’s never Donald’s fault,"" Cruz said. The Des Moines Register newspaper reported that former Iowa GOP Chairman Matt Strawn called Trump’s claims of voter fraud ""an absurd allegation."" A 2019 book, ""American Carnage: On the Front Lines of the Republican Civil War and the Rise of President Trump,"" by journalist Tim Alberta, reported that Trump urged Republican Party of Iowa Chair Jeff Kaufmann to invalidate the the 2016 caucuses’ results. We emailed the Iowa Republican Party about Trump’s statement after the 2024 caucus and received no response. Trump faced no serious primary opposition in 2020 In 2020, as the incumbent president, Trump faced no viable Republican challenger. Trump won 97.1% of the vote in the Iowa caucus while former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld won 1.3%. Weld, who led Massachusetts in the 1990s, ran as the vice presidential candidate on Gary Johnson’s libertarian ticket in 2016. He launched his long shot campaign against Trump in 2019, giving Republicans who were moderate or disliked Trump another option. Weld suspended his campaign in March 2020. Fast forward to 2024: On Jan. 15, Trump won Iowa with about 51% followed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis with about 21% and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley with 19%. These numbers show that Trump had his biggest win in 2020 — not in 2024. But 2020 was not a real contest for Trump. Our ruling Trump said of the Jan. 15 Iowa caucus that ""this is the third time we’ve won but this is the biggest win."" Trump did not explain how he arrived at his statement. By sheer numbers, however, he’s incorrect. Trump has twice won Iowa in the primaries — in 2020 and in 2024. In 2016, he finished second to Cruz. In 2020, Trump captured 97% of the vote against a nominal challenger to win. The Jan. 15 caucus awarded the former president about 51% of the vote. We rate his statement False.

"January 12, 2024",Donald Trump,“That’s why they are allowing these people to come in — people that don’t speak our language — they are signing them up to vote.”,pants-fire,Citizenship is a requirement to vote in federal elections. The process for immigrants to become citizens takes years. Cases of noncitizens voting are statistically rare. Some noncitizens accidentally end up on voter rolls when applying for driver’s licenses. States and counties have safeguards to check for voter eligibility. Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy. Learn more.,"Former President Donald Trump’s final push before the Iowa caucuses came with warnings about an outrageous Democratic scheme to register immigrants in the country illegally to vote. ""That’s why they are allowing these people to come in — people that don’t speak our language — they are signing them up to vote,"" Trump said Jan. 5 in Sioux Center, Iowa. ""And I believe that’s why you are having millions of people pour into our country and it could very well affect the next election. That’s why they are doing it."" Trump didn’t directly identify who ""they"" are but in his preceding comments, he talked about people who ""cheat on an election"" — language he often uses to talk about Democrats. Trump’s statements in majority-white Iowa, which holds its caucuses Jan. 15, fit in with conspiracy theories about ""white replacement"" or the ""great replacement,"" which claim white people of European descent are deliberately being replaced with nonwhite people. Trump has said false claims about immigrants voting in 2014, in 2016 as a presidential candidate, and again in 2020 after his reelection loss . There is nothing new about this claim in 2024. Our search for evidence turned up sporadic cases of noncitizens registering to vote or casting ballots. But we found no effort by the left to register people in the country illegally. ""There is zero evidence that institutionally the Democratic Party has been doing this,"" said Mike Madrid, a longtime Republican strategist in California who produces the Latino Vote podcast with Chuck Rocha, a Democratic political consultant. We asked Trump’s campaign for evidence and received no a reply. Voting by immigrants in U.S. illegally is rare Federal law requires citizenship to vote in national elections, and would-be voters sign a form attesting under penalty of perjury that they are citizens when they register to vote. States can check databases to verify voters’ citizenship. Fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens is often a result of misunderstandings or errors. For example, some noncitizens accidentally register to vote when applying for a driver’s license. But the number of people who fall into this category is ""minuscule,"" Rutgers University political science professor Lorraine Minnite previously told us . In Colorado, ahead of the 2022 midterm election, the secretary of state’s office mistakenly sent postcards to about 30,000 noncitizens who had driver’s licenses encouraging them to register to vote. The office sent a second postcard notifying these noncitizens about the error and worked with county clerks to ensure the ineligible voters did not register. In 2020, federal prosecutors charged 19 people in North Carolina with voter fraud after they cast ballots mostly in the 2016 election. Sixteen people pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors related to voting as a noncitizen. Three cases were dismissed. That was a big case, but keep in mind that more than 4.5 million people in North Carolina voted in the 2016 presidential election. An investigation in Georgia found 1,634 noncitizens who attempted to register to vote over 25 years , Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in 2022. Ultimately, no one was registered. ""The system worked to prevent illegal voting,"" said John Melvin, chief assistant district attorney in Gwinnett County, home to part of Atlanta. Noncitizens who vote could face serious consequences Voting by noncitizens carries high risks that include deportation or incarceration. Interacting with the government, including trying to vote, is something the undocumented population tries to avoid, said Madrid, the Republican strategist. ""They are not going to go register to vote and expose themselves."" The penalties are also high for a political party or volunteer who would try to sign up an ineligible voter. ""There are so many millions of citizens of eligible voting age, Latinos, that are not registered,"" Madrid said. It makes more sense to focus on them, he said. Republicans sometimes object to some communities allowing certain noncitizens to vote in local elections. Takoma Park, Maryland, has allowed it since 1993 . But, again, noncitizens aren't allowed to vote in presidential races. ""There is no indication that noncitizen voting in those localities has caused noncitizen voting in state or federal elections,"" said Wendy R. Weiser, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. It’s a long path for immigrants to gain the right to vote The process of becoming a citizen — and the right to vote that comes with it — can take a decade or longer. Border officials have encountered migrants nationwide 8.1 million times under President Joe Biden’s administration, as of November 2023. (If one person tries to enter the country three times and is stopped each time by border officials, that equals three encounters.) Also, not everyone encountered is let into the U.S. About 3.6 million encounters ended in people being deported from the country under Biden, DHS data shows. ""Even if many of these people found a path to legal status via asylum or other means, it would be many, many years before they would become eligible to vote given both the huge backlogs in adjudicating cases in immigration court and the fact that people spend years on a green card before being eligible for citizenship,"" Michelle Mittelstadt, a Migration Policy Institute spokesperson, previously told PolitiFact . Our ruling Trump said Democrats are allowing illegal immigrants ""to come in — people that don’t speak our language — they are signing them up to vote."" Trump provided no evidence for this scheme. Only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections, and proven incidents of noncitizens casting ballots are rare. Even immigrants who arrive now and apply for citizenship won’t be able to vote for more than a decade because of the lengthy citizenship process. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

"January 12, 2024",Joe Biden,“The racial wealth gap is the smallest it’s been in 20 years.”,half-true,"President Joe Biden referred to 2022 Federal Reserve data that showed a modest decrease in the wealth ratio between white and Black Americans. For every $100 the average white family had in wealth, the average Black family had $15.75, the smallest gap in 20 years. By a different measure — the dollar amount difference in wealth — the gap widened between white and Black Americans to its largest disparity since 1989. Economists use both measures to assess the racial wealth gap. Learn more about PolitiFact’s fact-checking process and rating system.","Ahead of South Carolina’s February primary, President Joe Biden appealed to the state’s Black voters by touting his administration’s efforts to bolster racial equity in the economy. ""We’re growing back Black wealth, but we have a lot more to do,"" he said Jan. 8 in Charleston at Mother Emanuel AME Church, the South’s oldest Black church. ""The racial wealth gap is the smallest it’s been in 20 years, under my watch. More Black small businesses are starting up than in decades. Opening a new business (is) the ultimate act of hope."" When we asked the White House for evidence, a spokesperson pointed us to a chart from the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, that shows the ratio of wealth between white and nonwhite families. By this single measure, Biden is accurate: The wealth ratio between white and Black families narrowed slightly in 2022 and is the smallest it’s been since 2001. However, this is not the only way to measure the racial wealth gap. The same Federal Reserve report that Biden referred to said racial wealth gaps "" persisted and widened "" in 2022 based on the dollar amount differences in median wealth between white and nonwhite families. Economists use both measures to assess the racial wealth gap, so Biden’s statement covered only half of the picture — and it was the more favorable half. All of the wealth measures calculate assets minus liabilities. Since Biden made the statement in the context of Black wealth and when speaking to a Black audience, we focused this fact-check on economic disparities between white and Black families. The Federal Reserve also reports wealth data for Hispanic, Asian and other nonwhite communities. Although average American families’ incomes grew during the COVID-19 pandemic, significant economic disparities between white and nonwhite families persisted. In 2022, the median wealth for white families was more than six times larger than that of Black families. Data on the racial wealth gap shows a mixed bag One way to determine the racial wealth gap is to measure Black families’ wealth in comparison with white families. This is calculated by dividing the median total wealth for Black families by the median total wealth for white families. The white-Black wealth ratio narrowed modestly in 2022, as the Federal Reserve reported . Still, white families had vastly more wealth than Black families. In 2022, for every $100 the average white family held, the average Black family had $15.75. That’s the most since 2001, when Black families had $15.79, but it still accounts for only about one-sixth of the white level. Another way the Federal Reserve measures the racial wealth gap is the absolute-dollar value difference in wealth between white and nonwhite families. By that measure, the racial wealth gap widened in 2022. The absolute-dollar 2022 median wealth for white families was $285,000, and just less than $45,000 for Black families, the Federal Reserve reported . Average wealth increased for families in all racial groups from 2019 to 2022, partly because of pandemic-era government benefits. Black families had the fastest growth in wealth during this period, with a 61% jump. The typical white family’s wealth increased 31%. However, despite this surge, Black families’ total dollar increase in wealth still trailed far behind that of white families. From 2019 to 2022, the median wealth for white families increased by almost $67,000. For Black families, median wealth increased about $17,000. Because of the uneven increases, the wealth gap between white and Black families expanded by about $50,000, bringing the total wealth disparity to more than $240,000. Both ways of measuring the racial wealth gap are accurate, said Jonathan Welburn, a senior researcher specializing in economics at the Rand Corp., a nonpartisan research organization. Welburn and other Rand researchers estimated in a May 2023 article that it would take trillions of dollars to eliminate the wealth gap between white and Black Americans. The racial wealth gap during the Biden administration In South Carolina, Biden took credit for the narrowing racial wealth ratio, saying it happened ""under my watch."" The Biden administration has announced efforts to address income inequality for Black Americans, including expanding access to home and business ownership. The Federal Reserve report said net housing wealth, investment income and businesses or self-employment were the top Black income growth drivers from 2019 to 2022. But other factors helping to reduce the wealth gap predated Biden’s presidency. The report said during this period, which intersected with the COVID-19 pandemic, incomes for nonwhite families were ""propped up"" by temporarily expanded government benefits, such as unemployment insurance and food stamps. Stimulus checks were another pandemic-era lifeline for Black Americans. Congress and the Trump administration approved these programs and Biden continued them. Our ruling Biden said, ""The racial wealth gap is the smallest it’s been in 20 years."" By one measure, the white-Black wealth ratio, that’s true. In 2022, that ratio modestly reduced to the smallest it’s been in 20 years. By a different measure, the dollar amount difference in wealth, the gap widened between white Americans and Black Americans to more than $240,000. That’s the largest disparity since 1989, the earliest year recorded in the Federal Reserve data. Biden’s claim is partially accurate, but leaves out additional context about how the Federal Reserve assesses the racial wealth gap in the U.S. We rate this claim Half True. "

Overall, there have been 3.6 million removals, returns and expulsions under Biden’s administration.","Republican primary presidential candidate Nikki Haley has pledged to deport people who have come to the U.S. illegally under President Joe Biden’s administration, as her rivals characterize her as soft on immigration. ""The 8 million that have come in illegally, we have to send them back because you have to look at the fact that every time we allow them to come in, we're incentivizing more to come,"" Haley, the former United Nations ambassador, said in a Jan. 5 interview with Iowa PBS. ""The idea that we've had 8 million and they only sent back 142,000 should scare everybody."" Haley, who is also South Carolina’s former governor, has made similar claims at CNN and Fox News town halls. During a Jan. 8 Fox News town hall, Haley repeated the 8 million figure and said ""Biden sent back only 142,000 last year. That’s it."" Haley makes it sound as if 8 million people are now living illegally in the U.S. and only 142,000 have been deported, and that’s not so. Nationwide data up to November 2023 shows that immigration officials have encountered migrants 8.1 million times under Biden. But the data represents events, not people. About 2.3 million people have been released into the U.S. under Biden’s administration, Department of Homeland Security data shows. Most of them are families, according to The Washington Post. About 356,000 children who crossed the border alone were also let in. Separately, DHS estimates that about 391,000 people have evaded border authorities. (The latest data DHS has published is for fiscal year 2021, which includes about four months of the Trump administration.) How many people have been sent out after reaching the border? U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 142,000 people in fiscal year 2023. These removals happened after an official court order and can include people who have been living in the U.S. for years before Biden’s administration. The total number of ICE removals under Biden’s administration so far is about 245,000. But immigration officials also turn people away through border ""returns"" and ""expulsions."" Returns happen when officials dispatch people to their home countries without legal penalties and without formal removal proceedings. Up through mid-May 2023, officials also expelled people under Title 42 , a public health policy; this began under the Trump administration as a way to mitigate COVID-19’s spread. The Biden administration recorded about 2.5 million Title 42 expulsions through May 2023. There have been more than 3.6 million removals, returns and expulsions from February 2021, Biden’s first month in office, to September 2023, based on Department of Homeland Security estimates. This data also represents events, not people. So, the same person can be expelled multiple times and each time would count as a separate expulsion. Our ruling Haley said, ""We’ve had 8 million"" immigrants come to the U.S. illegally under Biden and they only sent back 142,000."" There have been 8.1 million encounters with migrants nationwide under Biden, but that number does not represent unique individuals. And not all who were stopped were allowed to stay in the U.S. The 142,000 refers only to ICE removals in fiscal year 2023. But that is not the only way migrants can be sent out of the U.S. There have been 3.6 million removals, returns and expulsions under Biden’s administration. This data also represents events, not people. Haley’s claim contains an element of truth in the numbers she cites but ignores additional data and critical context about immigration.

"January 10, 2024",Facebook posts,Nikki Haley is ineligible to be president or vice president.,pants-fire,"The U.S. Constitution requires that a president be a natural-born citizen. It also says a person born in the U.S. is a citizen. Nikki Haley, a Republican candidate for president, meets eligibility requirements, experts said, because she was born in South Carolina. The citizenship status of Haley’s parents, who became citizens after her birth, don’t affect Haley’s eligibility for the job, experts said.","Baseless social media posts, including from former President Donald Trump, have claimed that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley is ineligible for the office she seeks. ""Nikki Haley’s parents were not U.S. citizens at the time of her birth in 1972,"" read the caption of a Jan. 5 Facebook post . ""Citizenship by birthplace ‘does not’ satisfy the ‘natural-born’ requirement as stated in the US Constitution."" The post shared a link to an article in the Gateway Pundit , a conservative website, which examined a recent analysis by Paul Ingrassia, a law clerk and Trump supporter, published Jan. 1 on the conservative website American Greatness. In his article, Ingrassia argued that because Haley’s parents weren’t yet American citizens when she was born in South Carolina, she is ineligible to be president. He said there’s a distinction between a ""natural-born citizen"" and ""birthright citizenship."" Natural-born citizens, Ingrassia said, must be born to U.S. citizen parents. Therefore, although Haley may have birthright citizenship because she was born on American soil, that doesn’t meet the Constitution’s Article 2 standard to run for president or vice president. The claim has been circulating on social media in recent days, and Trump on Truth Social shared the Gateway Pundit article on Jan. 8. But these social media posts are wrong. Haley was born in South Carolina and meets the U.S. Constitution’s requirements to run for president. ""It is absolutely clear that if Haley is a citizen by birth, she is eligible,"" Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, said. ""And it is absolutely clear that she is a citizen by birth. So there’s no substance to this."" Trump and others have made similar false ""birther"" claims about the eligibility of other presidential and vice presidential candidates, including the late Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz., Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama . Where was Haley born? Haley’s campaign website says she was born in 1972 in Bamberg, South Carolina. The State, a Columbia, South Carolina, newspaper, in 2015 wrote : ""Her father, Ajit Randhawa, became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1978, Haley’s office said. Her mother, Raj Randhawa, became a U.S. citizen in 2003, a year before Haley won a seat in the S.C. House."" The Haley campaign confirmed that the information in The State article was correct. What the Constitution, and legal experts, say Article 2, Section 1, of the Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born citizen, 35 years old and a U.S. resident for at least 14 years. It does not define ""natural-born citizen,"" nor does it say anything about the citizenship status of the president’s parents. The 14th Amendment states that all people ""born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" Michael Morley, a Florida State University law professor who teaches constitutional law, said the natural-born citizenship requirement to be president is not dependent on the status of Haley’s parents. It applies only to Haley. Because she was born in South Carolina, he said, ""Pursuant to the 14th Amendment’s Citizenship Clause, she was therefore a citizen from birth — a ‘natural born citizen’ — and is accordingly eligible to serve as president."" William & Mary Law School professor Rebecca Green pointed to the Constitution’s Article 2, which states, ""No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United States."" Green said: ""Anyone born in the United States satisfies that criteria."" Sarah Duggin, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, agreed with Green. Being born in South Carolina ""would make her a natural born US citizen by birth, regardless of whether her parents were US citizens at the time of her birth."" Besides the Constitution, a 1952 statute ( 8 U.S. Code § 1401 - Nationals and citizens of United States at birth ) states that people born in the United States are ""nationals and citizens."" In 1898, the U.S. Supreme Court said in a 6-2 decision that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese citizens, was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment. Our ruling Social media claims amplified by Trump and others claimed that Haley is ineligible for the job because her parents were not U.S. citizens when she was born in South Carolina. But that claim misinterprets the U.S. Constitution, legal experts say. The 14th Amendment states that any person born in the U.S. is a citizen. The Constitution’s Article 2 states that the president must be a natural-born citizen, And experts say anyone born in the U.S. meets that requirement.

Haley didn’t oppose Trump’s border wall. She said a wall was not enough to reduce illegal immigration. As she campaigns for the White House, Haley says she supports building a border wall and banning people from countries with terrorism ties.","As the New Hampshire primary nears, polls show former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley closing the gap between her and President Donald Trump, her rival for the Republican presidential nomination. Perhaps feeling the pressure, Trump, the GOP front-runner, is airing an ad in New Hampshire that casts him as a strong defender of U.S. borders while portraying Haley as weak. Ominous music plays as the 30-second ad shows footage of large groups of migrants heading to the border, and families in mourning as a narrator mentions fentanyl deaths. ""Yet Haley and Biden oppose Trump’s border wall,"" the narrator said. ""Confirmed warnings of terrorists sneaking in through our southern border. Yet Haley joined Biden in opposing Trump’s visitor ban from terrorist nations. ""Haley’s weakness puts us in grave danger. Trump’s strength protects us."" Text on the screen also said: ""Haley opposed Trump’s border wall"" and ""Haley opposed Trump’s travel ban."" The claims about Haley’s positions are wrong. Haley said more was needed to secure the border, but she didn’t oppose Trump’s border wall. She opposed a Muslim travel ban, but supported other iterations of Trump’s travel bans. Haley supported a border wall among other security measures On the border wall portion, the Trump ad cites a February 2023 Time article about Haley’s flip-flops around her former boss. The article linked to a 2015 Washington Post opinion piece about Haley’s remarks at a National Press Club luncheon that year. Haley said that securing the border wasn’t just about building a wall. ""Because a wall is not going to do it,"" she said Sept. 2, 2015. ""You’ve got to have commitment of ground troops, equipment, money, all of that to bring it together. Then you’re being serious about tackling illegal immigration."" During an April 2023 trip to the southwest border, Haley praised border fencing she said was installed by the Trump administration, saying more of it is needed. ""It’s a complete lie,"" Haley said about the Trump ad on Fox News Jan. 5. ""First of all I didn’t say I opposed the border wall, I said I opposed just doing a border wall, I said that we have to do more than that."" Haley supported a ban that did not single out people for their religion As a presidential candidate in 2015, Trump called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" Haley, then South Carolina’s governor, called Trump’s proposal ""an embarrassment"" that ""defies everything that this country was based on."" The Trump ad cites those comments, ignoring that she supported the travel bans he issued when she was part of his administration. The U.S. Senate approved Haley’s confirmation as U.N. ambassador Jan. 24, 2017. Four days later, Trump signed an executive order banning citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days. Those seven countries ""repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism,"" according to an anti-terrorism law signed by Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama. PolitiFact didn’t find any public comments from Haley about the executive order at the time. After court challenges, Trump revised that order to exclude Iraq. That new order also exempted U.S. legal permanent residents and people with U.S. visas. In a March 2017 NBC interview , Haley said she supported the new version. ""It’s not a Muslim ban. I will never support a Muslim ban. I don’t think we should ever ban anyone based on their religion,"" she said. After additional court challenges , Trump issued a third version of the travel ban, restricting U.S. entry to people from Chad, North Korea and Venezuela. The Supreme Court in June 2018 upheld this travel ban. Haley continued to defend the policy in an interview with NDTV that month, saying the executive order was ""not a Muslim ban,"" because not all Muslim-majority countries were on the list and not all countries on the list were Muslim-majority. ""This is about safety. This is about terrorism,"" Haley said. Haley’s position is similar years later in this presidential campaign. In response to Trump’s ad, her campaign said that she ""supported banning travel for people from countries with serious terrorist activity, but opposed religious tests."" Our ruling A Trump ad claimed that Haley ""opposed Trump’s border wall"" and ""Trump’s travel ban."" Haley did not oppose Trump’s border wall. In 2015, she said border security required more than a border wall and that technology, infrastructure and funding were also needed. On the 2024 campaign trail, Haley has said she wants to finish building a border wall. Haley supported three versions of Trump’s travel bans, saying they were focused on safety, not religion. She opposed a religion-based ban. As a presidential candidate, Haley has said she supports banning entry to people from countries with terrorist activities. We rate Trump’s claims False. "

""Instead, the report relies upon innuendo, implication and poor data analysis to reach a conclusion about fraudulent votes being cast when the evidence supposedly supporting that conclusion simply cannot justify that conclusion."" PolitiFact has documented some examples of voter fraud in 2020 , such as people casting votes on behalf of dead relatives. But these instances were not enough to change the race’s outcome, and some crimes were committed by Republicans . Examples cited in the report do not prove that fraudulent ballots were cast for Biden. The 2020 election’s outcome was verified in many ways. States certified the results. Congress accepted the results. Trump and his allies lost more than 60 lawsuits . A group of conservatives, including former federal judges, examined every fraud and miscount claim by Trump and concluded that they ""failed to present evidence of fraud or inaccurate results significant enough to invalidate the results."" On the same day Trump shared this report, USA Today published an op-ed by Ken Block headlined : ""Trump paid me to find voter fraud. Then he lied after I found 2020 election wasn't stolen."" Block, a former Rhode Island gubernatorial candidate who founded Simpatico Software Systems, was hired by the Trump campaign to try to back up Trump’s allegations after the election. His work is now in the hands of prosecutors who have charged Trump with crimes for actions leading to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. ""What these claims don’t take into account is that voter fraud is detectable, quantifiable and verifiable,"" Block wrote in USA Today. ""I have yet to see anyone offer up ‘evidence’ of voter fraud from the 2020 election that provides these three things."" We fact-checked a sample of the allegations in the report Trump shared. Trump campaign spokespeople and his lawyers didn’t answer our emails asking to identify the report’s author.

(AP) Arizona The allegations about Arizona largely focus on Maricopa County, the jurisdiction with more than half of the state’s voters. State Senate Republicans ordered a review of the ballots and found that Biden beat Trump by about 45,000 votes — virtually the same as the county’s official canvass. The report Trump shared repeats some debunked claims. For example, it said that Maricopa County accepted 18,000 mail ballots the day after the 2020 election from the U.S. Postal Service. The Associated Press concluded that the claim was wrong. The number referred to a form showing when early ballots received before the deadline were handed to a private vendor for scanning, a Maricopa County Elections Department spokesperson told the AP. ""In our legal system, there comes a time when questions are finally settled,"" Paul Bender, an Arizona State University law professor, told PolitiFact ""That time has come with regard to the validity of Biden's election.""

State Farm Arena in Atlanta reported that one room being used for ballot counting had a 6 a.m. water leak. There was a brief delay in tabulating absentee ballots during the two hours required to repair the leak, which resulted from an overflowing urinal. No ballots were damaged, the arena said . In June 2023, the State Election Board dismissed a case about alleged malfeasance at the arena concluding ""there was no evidence of any type of fraud as alleged."" The Trump document cites questionable sources, including True the Vote about ballot drop boxes — the focus of the ""2,000 Mules"" documentary by Dinesh D’Souza. The 2022 film alleged massive voter fraud involving ballot drop boxes and cellphone location data, based on several hundred phones passing by drop boxes. ""These assertions are part of a dancing fountain of lies that have been disproven by the count, the recount, and the audit of the 2020 vote in Georgia, and for which not one single shred of evidence has been offered,"" said Mike Hassinger, a Georgia Secretary of State spokesperson. ""Sixteen individual lawsuits were brought to challenge the validity of Georgia’s 2020 election results, of which 12 were dismissed by the courts, and four withdrawn by former President Trump’s own lawyers.""

(AP) Michigan One of the report’s allegations about Michigan centered around suspected voter irregularities in Muskegon, a city of about 38,000 people. The report claimed police documented ""a fraudulent voter registration scheme,"" but this was kept ""hidden"" for almost three years. The report’s source is The Gateway Pundit, and in August we rated the underlying claim False. Here’s what happened: The Muskegon city clerk alerted police after noticing irregularities on some of the 8,000 to 10,000 voter registration forms dropped off by a canvasser. Local and state police referred the case to the FBI, because the canvasser’s employer, GBI Strategies, was operating in multiple states. Danny Wimmer, press secretary for Michigan’s attorney general, told PolitiFact that officials hadn’t ruled out the possibility that a crime may have been committed, but none of the agencies involved in the investigation found any evidence of successful fraudulent voter registrations. Philadelphia election workers scan ballots for the general election Nov. 3, 2020, at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia. (AP) Pennsylvania The report repeated a false claim Trump and his supporters pushed about ballot counting in Philadelphia in the days following the election. It alleged that in Pennsylvania’s largest city, ""hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots were unlawfully counted in secret,"" and Republican poll watchers were barred from observing the vote count. Election observers representing the Trump campaign and the Republican Party were allowed to observe the ballot-counting process, alongside Democrats. In Philadelphia, a judge allowed observers from both parties to view the process from 6 feet away. ""Nothing was done in secret or against a court order,"" said Nick Custodio, a Philadelphia City Commissioners office spokesperson. A ballot drop box sits outside City Hall in Milwaukee ahead of the 2020 election. (Rick Wood / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) Wisconsin After losing Wisconsin to Biden, Trump allies filed lawsuits seeking to invalidate votes cast by drop box. The report cites the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling in one of the lawsuits, which prohibited the use of drop boxes, except inside election offices. This ruling was announced one month before the state’s primary election for the 2022 midterms and applies to future elections; it does not retroactively apply to the 2020 election. An AP analysis found that the state’s expanded use of drop boxes in the 2020 election did not trigger widespread fraud. The Wisconsin Elections Commission saw no instances in which ballot drop boxes were damaged or used to submit fraudulent ballots. Our ruling If there was definitive evidence that Biden’s 2020 victory was secured on fraud, we would have it by now. The document shared by Trump is a lot of smoke — so much that we rate its central claim Pants on Fire!  "
"January 5, 2024",TikTok posts,"“Almost a million people, mostly Democrats, have been kicked off the voter roll here in Florida” because of efforts to place a proposed amendment on abortion access on the state’s 2024 ballot.",barely-true,The state’s active voter list decreased by about 1 million people from the end of 2022 through 2023. County election supervisors move voters off the active list based on state law. Updating the voter rolls is unrelated to an effort to protect abortion rights through a question on the November ballot.,"Abortion rights supporters in Florida are hopeful that a question will land on the November ballot that will let voters ensure abortion rights. But if you believe a TikTok video, election officials have conspired to prevent passage by kicking Democrats off voter rolls. The TikTok user said Florida voter roll data showed that ""almost a million people, mostly Democrats, have been kicked off the voter roll."" The speaker, who did not answer our message, said in the video that a half-million Democrats were ""purged"" from the voter roll ""because they know Florida women are about to put abortion rights (in) on the Constitution in 2024."" A TikTok user tagged us in the comments to verify whether this is true, so we investigated. (We have a separate partnership with TikTok to analyze videos flagged as potential misinformation.) Our review shows county officials have removed about 1 million people from voting lists, and about half were Democrats. Why? It’s part of their annual work to comply with state law. We found no evidence that voters were removed to thwart a potential question on the November ballot to protect abortion rights . The abortion question will appear on the ballot if organizers collect the required nearly 900,000 signatures by Feb. 1, which appears to have been met , and the Florida Supreme Court approves the ballot language. A University of North Florida poll in November showed strong support. Florida routinely updates voter rolls before federal elections The TikTok video shows voter registration data posted by Brian Beute, a candidate for Seminole County elections supervisor. Beute cited state data showing that near the end of 2023, Florida had 13.5 million active registered voters, down from 14.5 million in 2022. That included a decline of about 153,000 Republicans and 467,000 Democrats, while the rest were largely unaffiliated with a party. The decline happened despite state population growth . But that’s not the complete voter registration list, because it does not include inactive voters. ""Inactive voters are still registered voters,"" said Mark Ard, Florida Division of Elections spokesperson. ""Inactive voters can’t be removed until after two general election cycles of inactivity because of federal and state law."" Inactivity means not voting or having any contact with the elections office. ""Basically they need to fog a mirror for us — call us to request a ballot, show up at a polling place to vote,"" said Broward County Elections Supervisor Joe Scott. New election laws changed voter removal processes The decline of 1 million active voters was more than in recent years. ""It is unusual to have this many voters be removed from the voter rolls in one year,"" said Mark Earley, Leon County elections supervisor. ""But it is due to election law changes over the last three legislative cycles."" Florida, like all states, focused on updating voter rolls in odd-numbered years because of federal law that prohibits most removals within 90 days of a federal election. With primaries and a general election, there are few windows for this to happen. In 2022, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed S.B. 524 , which required county election supervisors to update the voter rolls annually. In 2023, DeSantis signed S.B. 7050 , another elections bill that changed how election officials remove voters who have died, been convicted of felonies or moved. The recent law shortened the process for providing voters with notice of removal. Before that law passed, if voters did not answer a final notice within 30 days to confirm they remained at the address and the notice didn’t bounce back, those voters stayed on the active list. Earley said that resulted in a backlog of voters who had moved out of the county or state but remained active registered voters, with no easy way to correct it. Under the new law, voters who don’t respond are moved to the inactive list. Then, if the voters have no contact with the elections office over two federal election cycles, those voters are removed. It did not surprise officials that the active-voter list declined by far more Democrats than Republicans. Democrats tend to be younger and more mobile and are therefore more likely to be removed from the voter rolls, said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political science professor. However, the number of active voters will likely rise as Floridians register or update their status before November. Our ruling A TikTok user said, ""Almost a million people, mostly Democrats, have been kicked off the voter roll here in Florida"" because of a question about abortion that could appear on the 2024 ballot. There is an element of truth, because almost 1 million people were removed from the active-voter list, and about half were Democrats. However, the post misleads about the reason. County election officials must follow state law to remove voters from the active list, and voters on the inactive list are teed up for removal years later. A question could be placed on the November ballot to protect abortion rights, but there is no evidence that this influenced election officials who were updating voter rolls. We rate this statement Mostly False.  "
"• January 4,",Ron DeSantis,"Donald Trump “deported less, believe it or not, than Barack Obama even did.""",true,"The federal government says a deportation is the removal of a noncitizen from the U.S. for violating immigration law. Federal data — tracking removals, returns and expulsions — shows Barack Obama deported more people in each of his terms than Trump did.","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that if elected president, he’d do better at deporting people who are illegally in the country than former President Donald Trump did. ""Trump promised the largest deportations in history,"" DeSantis said Jan. 2 during a town hall hosted by Gray Television. ""He deported less, believe it or not, than Barack Obama even did."" As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump promised to deport every immigrant living in the U.S. illegally (then estimated to be 11 million people). He failed to do so, earning him a Promise Broken on PolitiFact’s Trump-O-Meter promise tracker. But did Trump deport fewer people than Obama? There are different deportation metrics, and Obama surpassed Trump’s numbers in each one. Immigrant rights advocates had dubbed Obama the ""deporter-in-chief"" by the time he left office in 2017. The federal government classifies deportations as the removal of noncitizens from the U.S. It tracks it in a few different ways: Removals: When people are sent out of the U.S. via an official court order, often penalized for the illegal entry. This can include people who have lived in the United States for years and people who recently arrived. Returns: When people are returned to their home countries without legal penalties and without being placed in formal removal proceedings. This happens at the border. Title 42 expulsions: These happened from March 2020 to May 2023 under a public health policy . Some people arriving at the border were not let into the United States and were expelled without legal penalties. Under Trump, from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2020 the Department of Homeland Security recorded 2 million deportations, a combination of all three metrics. (Fiscal year 2017 included about four months of the Obama administration.) During Obama’s first term, fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2012, there were 3.2 million deportations (removals and returns). Fiscal year 2009 included about four months of the second George W. Bush administration. During Obama’s second term, covering fiscal years 2013 through 2016, there were 2.1 million deportations (removals and returns). These figures — for Obama and Trump — include deportations of people stopped at the border and people who were already living in the U.S. and picked up by immigration authorities. A DeSantis campaign spokesperson pointed us to a 2020 report from the libertarian Cato Institute that supports DeSantis’ claim. The report focused on Immigration and Customs Enforcement removals of people already living in the U.S., and shows that there were more deportations under each of Obama’s terms compared with Trump’s term. ""By any measure, the Trump administration failed to meaningfully increase immigration enforcement in the interior of the United States,"" compared with the Obama administration, the report said. Our ruling DeSantis said Trump ""deported less, believe it or not, than Barack Obama even did."" Federal data tracking the removals, returns and expulsions of noncitizens supports this claim. During each of his terms, Obama deported more people than Trump did during his term. We rate DeSantis’ claim True. "
"December 21, 2023",Donald Trump,“They want to make our Army tanks all electric.”,false,"The U.S. Army released a 2022 climate strategy document that says that ""fully electric tactical vehicles are still years into the future."" Tactical vehicles transport troops or fuel and are different from combat vehicles such as tanks. An Army spokesperson told PolitiFact that the Army is focusing the strategy on tactical wheeled vehicles, not tanks.","Former President Donald Trump said at a recent New Hampshire rally that President Joe Biden is imposing his climate agenda on the U.S. military. ""The worst thing is they want to make our Army tanks all electric,"" Trump said Dec. 16 in Durham. Trump said the vehicles will be used ""as we blast our way through enemy territory in an environmentally friendly manner."" He added that Biden puts ""environmental maniacs first."" He has made similar statements on Truth Social and at Florida and Texas campaign rallies. The U.S. Army has outlined a strategy to transition to electric vehicles, but it begins with the nontactical fleet — which includes commercially available vehicles such as sedans, station wagons, utility vehicles and trucks — and some goals are decades away. Army spokesperson Ellen Lovett told PolitiFact that the Army is focusing strategy on tactical wheeled vehicles, not tanks. ""There is no goal to fully electrify every single vehicle in the fleet by 2050,"" said Fabian Villalobos, an engineer at the Rand Corp., a nonpartisan research organization that has an Army research division . Strategy calls for electrical tactical vehicles by 2050 The U.S. Army released a 2022 climate strategy that says ""fully electric tactical vehicles are still years into the future."" Villalobos said tactical vehicles carry troops or fuel and are different from combat vehicles such as tanks. The strategy includes a timeline to add: An all-electric light-duty nontactical vehicle fleet by 2027. An all-electric nontactical vehicle fleet by 2035. Hybrid-drive tactical vehicles by 2035. Fully electric tactical vehicles by 2050, and the necessary charging infrastructure. The strategy document doesn’t mention tanks. Villalobos said he currently knows of no plans to introduce or prototype an electric tank. ""Tanks are simply too heavy to be fully electrified at this time, but hybrids may be possible,"" as demonstrated by prototyping efforts, Villalobos said. The strategy aims to maximize efficiency in warfighting logistics, Michael Knickerbocker, a U.S. Navy surface warfare officer, wrote in a 2022 op-ed when he was a federal executive fellow at the Clements Center for National Security at the University of Texas at Austin. Military experts told us that electric vehicle advantages include: Reducing dependency on foreign adversaries for fuel. Fewer front-lines trips and less risk. If less fuel needs to be delivered to the new vehicles on front lines, soldiers make fewer delivery trips and reduce their risk of harm. Stealthier travel without emissions, smoke or noise that alert adversaries. The Modern War Institute at West Point published a 2022 article that said the Army successfully piloted electric light-duty nontactical vehicles. But generally ""the technology is not ready for tactical vehicles because it requires incredibly heavy and bulky infrastructure for power generation and charging."" The article said critics of electrifying military vehicles ignore telectrification’s benefits, which ""will help make our forces more lethal and save the military money."" The idea of introducing electric Army vehicles is not new or unique to the Biden administration. The Army entertained the idea of an electric ""cannon-vehicle"" as far back as 1995 , Rand researchers wrote . In 2012, the Defense Department studied the possibility of adding nontactical electric vehicles. When contacted for comment, a Trump campaign spokesperson sent news articles about the Biden administration’s goals for military electric vehicles, but none showed that the administration wants electric Army tanks. The Trump campaign also cited a 2021 Military.com article that was published before the 2022 Army strategy. In it, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said tactical vehicles would first go to hybrid and nontactical vehicles on bases could transition directly to electric. Our ruling Trump said ""they want to make our Army tanks all electric."" A 2022 Army climate strategy document sets a timeline for transitioning certain types of vehicles to electric over decades, with a goal of having fully electric tactical vehicles by 2050. The strategy document doesn’t mention tanks, and tactical vehicles are different from combat vehicles such as tanks. We rate this statement False.

"December 19, 2023",Nikki Haley,"“We’ve had more Americans die of fentanyl than the Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam wars, combined.”",true,"About 65,300 soldiers died in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined. About 127,000 Americans died from drug overdoses involving a synthetic opioid other than methadone in 2020 and 2021, federal data shows. These deaths are primarily because of fentanyl. War deaths are often used as a way to illustrate the scale of a public health crisis. U.S. health officials typically track opioid deaths alongside deaths from other public health causes like heart disease or cancer.","ATKINSON, N.H. — Addressing a conference room full of New Hampshire voters, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley shared a grave statistic about the synthetic opioid fentanyl. ""We’ve had more Americans die of fentanyl than the Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam wars, combined,"" the former South Carolina governor said Dec. 14 at the Atkinson Resort and Country Club in Atkinson. Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid. It is used legally in pharmaceuticals, but most deaths are connected to its illegal manufacture and distribution. Small amounts can be lethal. The opioid factored in nearly 400 New Hampshire deaths in 2022, numbers from New Hampshire’s chief medical examiner show. The state’s high rate of opioid-related deaths have been a leading public health concern for several years , just as national overdose deaths have also climbed . Federal data shows Haley’s math is accurate when measuring national fentanyl deaths against U.S. military deaths. About 127,000 Americans died from drug overdoses involving a synthetic opioid other than methadone (primarily fentanyl) in 2020 and 2021 alone compared with 65,278 U.S. military personnel who died in Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. Although public officials have long compared drug deaths with war fatalities, U.S. health officials approach addiction issues as public health matters and typically compare opioid deaths with deaths from other public health causes. Military and drug overdose deaths Military data from the Defense Department’s Defense Casualty Analysis System shows 65,278 people died during the three conflicts when counting hostile battles and other nonhostile, in-theater situations. These figures include deaths from accidents, illness, injury and or self-inflicted causes. In 2021 alone, the National Center for Health Statistics reported more than 106,000 drug overdose deaths. Of those, 70,601 involved synthetic opioids other than methadone. Fentanyl overdoses are not specifically separated out, but the agency’s reports say that the fatalities in this category are primarily because of fentanyl. That was up from 2020 , when 56,516 people died from drug overdoses involving synthetic opioids other than methadone. With just a few years worth of data, it is clear that the fentanyl death toll surpasses the wartime death toll Haley specified. We have seen this war death comparison before This is not the first time we have seen war deaths used to illustrate a public health issue’s direness. Politicians and television commentators have used military conflicts to illustrate the toll of gun violence , and more recently President Joe Biden used them to quantify deaths from COVID-19 . Drugs-and-war parallels have been hard to avoid since 1971, when President Richard Nixon declared a ""war"" on illegal drugs. ""Comparing deaths linked to public health crises to war deaths, and especially the Vietnam War, is a pretty common thing,"" said David Herzberg, a drug historian and professor at the University at Buffalo. ""And on its face it is a reasonable strategy for conveying gravity,"" or seriousness of a crisis. Fentanyl has taken a deadly toll , especially on younger adults. A Washington Post analysis found that fentanyl overdoses are the leading cause of death for American adults aged 18 to 49. Drug overdose deaths are counted among the entire U.S. population of over 330 million people ; casualties of soldiers occur within a smaller population, so deaths will never surpass the number of people who serve in a given conflict. For Vietnam, that was about 2.7 million, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs . But experts like David Luckey, a senior international and defense researcher at the global policy think tank Rand Corp., said that this sort of comparison can ""show the scope of this problem"" and put the scale of the illicit fentanyl crisis in a perspective that people can understand. Comparing the fentanyl death toll to other public health crises such as heart attacks or car accidents, ""would technically be more accurate,"" said Herzberg, ""but might not get the idea across because the public may not know whether those other things are really big problems or not — so they aren’t as useful as a benchmark."" The CDC counts drug overdose deaths in the category of ""accidents (unintentional injuries)."" In 2021 , heart disease, cancer and COVID-19 claimed more lives than those who died in accidents. The CDC reported that 695,547 died from heart disease, 605,213 from cancer and 416,893 from COVID-19. The overall number of death counts from accidents was 224,935, of which opioid deaths made up a major portion. Fentanyl as a Chinese threat Haley’s other comments hint at why she’s invoking war numbers. She said fentanyl deaths are among many reasons why she believes China is the United States’ leading national security threat. ""China has been preparing for war with us for years,"" Haley said. China was the primary source of illicit fentanyl early in the U.S. opioid epidemic, we found . But when the Chinese government banned fentanyl production in 2019, producers switched tactics. A 2022 Congressional Research Service report found that Chinese traffickers no longer send fentanyl directly to the U.S. Instead, chemists send the materials to Mexican criminal organizations who then produce the fentanyl. Data shows that the vast majority of people sentenced for fentanyl trafficking are U.S. citizens. Our ruling Haley said, ""We’ve had more Americans die of fentanyl than the Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam wars, combined."" Her numbers are right. About 127,000 Americans died from drug overdoses involving a synthetic opioid other than methadone (primarily fentanyl) in 2020 and 2021 compared with 65,278 U.S. military personnel who died in Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. We rate this claim True. "
"• December 19,",James Woods,Joe Biden’s net worth was $41 million in 2022.,false,"After leaving the vice presidency, Joe Biden increased his wealth through book deals and speaking engagements. His published financial disclosures, tax filings and news reports point to a net worth of around $10 million, not $41 million as actor James Woods’ X post said.","Before he was vice president or president, Joe Biden was one of Congress’ least wealthy members. Now one critic says Biden’s net worth more than quadrupled since before he moved into the White House. Actor James Woods shared an image on social media that said Biden’s net worth has increased from $9 million in 2019 to $41 million in 2022. Net worth is the value of people’s income and assets minus the debt and other liabilities they owe. ""I’m shocked,"" Woods, an outspoken supporter of former President Donald Trump, wrote Dec. 10 on X, formerly Twitter. The image Woods shared also questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’ assets, but we focused on the Biden claim. Financial disclosures, tax filings and news reports show that Biden’s net worth has grown slightly since entering the White House, but nothing on the scale Woods suggests. Forbes in August wrote that Biden’s net worth was at $10 million, up from about $8 million when he entered the White House in 2020. ""The increase has nothing to do with family business dealings in far-flung countries,"" Forbes wrote . ""Instead, he is getting richer by doing what a lot of 80-year-old Americans are doing: sitting on real estate. The president owns two homes in Delaware that are worth an estimated $7 million combined, $1.8 million more than they were when he took office."" Much of the Bidens’ current net worth is from the combined value of their two Delaware homes, which include a six-bedroom mansion in Rehoboth Beach that they purchased in 2017, Forbes reported . After leaving the vice presidency in 2017, Biden’s income increased substantially. In 2017 alone, Forbes found, Joe and Jill Biden brought in $11.1 million — nearly double their total earnings from 1998 to 2016. In 2018, they brought in another $4.6 million. Speaking engagements and book deals drove much of that new wealth before 2020 . As president, Biden earns $400,000 a year. His 2022 financial disclosures, published by the White House in May, show he has assets between $1 million and $2.65 million . But these figures represented little change from 2021, his first full year as president. We rate the claim that Biden’s net worth was $41 million in 2022 False. "

"December 19, 2023",Chris Christie,"Under the Trump administration's trade deal, “China's only fulfilled one-third of the promises of agricultural products that they were supposed to buy from our farmers.”",half-true,"By conventional calculations, China met 83% of its commitment for agricultural purchases. Christie offered an alternative calculation that doesn’t credit China for the level of purchases it was already making in 2017. This other calculation produces a result of about 40%, which is a bit higher than the one-third Christie cited. Experts say that overall, China did not fulfill its commitments to buy U.S. goods and services, even though the rate was better for agricultural goods than it was for other categories.","LONDONDERRY, N.H. — Republican presidential candidates on the 2024 campaign trail are unwaveringly critical of China, and often of U.S. policy toward the economic giant. At a town hall in Londonderry, New Hampshire, presidential candidate and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie directed the discussion of China toward agriculture and trade, taking a shot at one of his campaign rivals, former President Donald Trump. Christie told the audience that Trump ""said he made the greatest trade deals with China, right? You've heard him brag about his trade deals. Do you know, on the agricultural trade deals that he made, China's only fulfilled one-third of the promises of agricultural products that they were supposed to buy from our farmers? One-third."" We examined the data and found that Christie’s math conflicts with the standard way these numbers are calculated. But his approach is reasonable. China’s promises In January 2020, about a year before he left the White House, Trump signed what he called a ""historical trade deal"" with China. Under the agreement, China pledged to purchase $200 billion of additional U.S. exports before Dec. 31, 2021. The agreement was widely regarded as unsuccessful, partly because of the coronavirus pandemic, which struck within weeks and prompted a worldwide recession. It was ""a terrible agreement,"" said Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Overall, calculations by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, show China bought about 58% of what it had pledged in 2020 and 2021, the two years that were officially part of the agreement. China bought 37% of its promised amount in energy, 54% in services, and 59% in manufacturing. However, China fared the best in the one remaining major sector — the one Christie cited in his town hall. In agriculture, China met 83% of its goal, which is far higher than the one-third Christie said. Within the agriculture sector, China’s progress varied, Peterson Institute for International Economics data shows. China bought more than it had promised of pork, corn, wheat and sorghum, a grain used heavily as livestock feed. It missed goals for soybeans; cotton; lobster; and raw hides and skins. ""Overall, China is way short of its promises, but for agricultural products it may be somewhat closer to the mark,"" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow with the Peterson Institute. The agreement covered only two years, 2020 and 2021, but since the agreement ended, agricultural exports to China continued to climb, reaching $40.9 billion in 2022, a 14.5% increase from 2021, according to the Agriculture Department. Christie’s calculation Trade experts pointed PolitiFact to the standard calculations the Peterson Institute made. However, Christie’s campaign offered an alternative way of measuring the numbers. The Peterson Institute’s calculation compared the total amount China promised to purchase with what it bought. Over the two years, it promised to buy $73.9 billion in exports and it bought $61.1 billion — or 83%. Rather than looking at how much of the total commitment China met, Christie’s campaign measured how much China spent in 2020-21 beyond its 2017 levels. Plugging the Peterson Institute data into the Christie campaign’s formula shows that the additional Chinese spending in 2020 and 2021 accounted for 40% of its commitment over 2017’s baseline level. That’s higher than one-third, but relatively close. One note: Christie’s team used Chinese import data , rather than U.S. export data, so the numbers, for technical reasons, differ slightly from the export data used to calculate the 83%. For example, that same value, calculated with import data, shows China met 77% of its commitment. This difference does not account for the gap between 40% and Christie’s claim of ""one-third,"" however. Our ruling Christie said that under Trump’s trade deal, ""China's only fulfilled one-third of the promises of agricultural products that they were supposed to buy from our farmers."" By conventional calculations, China met 83% of its commitment for agricultural purchases. Christie offered an alternative calculation that doesn’t credit China for the purchases it was already making in 2017. This calculation produces a result of about 40%, which is higher than the one-third Christie cited. Experts say that overall, China did not fulfill its commitments for buying U.S. goods and services, though the rate was better for agricultural goods than for other categories. We rate the statement Half True. "
"December 18, 2023",Ron DeSantis,"Discussing gender-affirming surgical care for minors, said that Sweden “shut it down.”",half-true,"Gender-affirming care for transgender youth largely involves social support, puberty blockers and hormones. Surgeries are rare. Sweden’s restrictions on genital surgeries for minors trace to a 1970s sterilization law. Swedish health officials in 2022 issued guidelines limiting the use of puberty blockers, hormones and mastectomies for minors to ""exceptional cases."" These are recommendations, not law.","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said parents who seek gender-affirming care for their children subject those children to abuse — so much so that other nations have sought to ban it. During the fourth Republican presidential primary debate Dec. 6 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, DeSantis cited Sweden as an example. ""As a parent, you do not have the right to abuse your kids,"" DeSantis said . ""This is cutting off their genitals, this is mutilating these minors, these are irreversible procedures. And this is something that other countries in Europe like Sweden, once they started doing it, they saw it did incalculable damage. They've shut it down."" It is hard for transgender minors to get gender-affirming surgical care in Sweden. But much of that stems from a 1970s law that is unrelated to DeSantis’ point. In 2022, health officials updated guidance for people younger than 18, advising chest surgery only in ""exceptional cases."" However, the new guidance is a recommendation — and is not comparable to the legal bans in some U.S. states. What is gender-affirming care, and where does surgery fit in? Gender-affirming care is an individualized approach to health care that supports transgender and nonbinary people’s gender identity and it can go beyond medical interventions. For the small population of transgender youth, this mainly involves support through social transition, puberty blockers and hormones as children become adolescents. The gender-affirming surgery DeSantis cited is rarely performed on minors, said Dr. Marci Bowers , a gynecological surgeon and president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. Surgeries on minors happen ""only under the most severe conditions of gender dysphoria,"" she said. Gender dysphoria is the experience of distress that results when people’s sex assigned at birth does not match their gender identity. "" Top surgeries ,"" or mastectomies, are more common than surgeries that alter genitalia. In Europe more broadly, gender-affirming care availability is more often dictated by health policy or guidelines, not legal prohibitions. U.S. lawmakers have taken a different approach, with states in some cases banning certain procedures. DeSantis signed a law in May that banned all gender-affirming medical care —– including puberty blockers, hormones and surgery. Sweden has long restricted genital surgery A 1975 Swedish law , which ended a decadeslong eugenics and forced sterilization program, says that people younger than 18 cannot have genital surgeries. But the law doesn’t explicitly ban transgender care. People seeking genital surgery must apply and be approved by the Legal Council at the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare. People younger than 23 seeking this surgery need ""special circumstances"" to get their applications approved, according to the Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex Rights, also known as RFSL. Sweden’s new guidance on ‘top’ surgery and puberty blockers In national guidelines updated in 2022, Swedish health officials cautioned that ""the risks of puberty blockers and gender-affirming treatment are likely to outweigh the expected benefits."" The guidelines recommended limiting use of puberty blockers, hormones and mastectomies to ""exceptional cases."" ""The guidelines are recommendations, and it's up to the physicians to interpret them and make a judgement in each specific case,"" said Jêran Rostam, an expert in trangender issues at RFSL. The guidelines don’t ""ban"" top surgeries, but do signal shrinking access to the procedure. Our ruling Speaking about gender-affirming surgical care for minors, DeSantis said Sweden ""shut it down."" A 1970s law on sterilization requires people in Sweden to be 18 or older to qualify for genital surgeries. The law does not explicitly ban transgender care. Citing potential risks, Swedish health officials in 2022 advised that mastectomies for minors be reserved for ""exceptional cases."" But it is not a legal prohibition.

"December 15, 2023",Asa Hutchinson,China is allowed to do crypto mining in the U.S.,mostly-true,"Crypto mining involves extracting new ""currency"" through the energy-intensive process of having computers solve mathematical equations. Lawmakers and policy analysts are concerned, both because of the energy required and the Chinese ownership of some crypto mining companies. Although there are federal safeguards, and some state laws protecting against foreign government-backed business influence, analysts say greater regulation is warranted. Some U.S.-based crypto mining operations are part of China’s private sector but could pose a risk of Chinese government or Communist Party influence, China policy experts told PolitiFact.","MANCHESTER, N.H. — Addressing a forum of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, Republican 2024 presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he wants the crypto industry to thrive — but with some regulation. ""I want them to have rules that can be followed, and Congress needs to act,"" Hutchinson said Dec. 11 at a candidate forum sponsored by the U.S.-based advocacy group Stand with Crypto Alliance. ""It makes no sense to me: If we're trying to prohibit communist China from buying farmland in America, why are we allowing them to do crypto mining in the United States of America?"" All of the GOP presidential primary candidates have made China a favorite talking point and say it has outsized influence on U.S. policy and business. Lawmakers in 31 states introduced bills this year to block Chinese citizens, businesses and government from buying U.S. agricultural land or property near military bases, The Washington Post reported . But elected leaders generally haven’t taken such steps on China crypto mining, as Hutchison said. The effect of Chinese influence on crypto mining is an emerging area of concern among lawmakers and policy analysts. The federal Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is authorized to review certain transactions involving foreign investment to identify national security threats. Some states are grappling with balancing laws that encourage cryptocurrency industry growth with regulations that guard against potential security threats from foreign actors. Asked about his claim, Hutchinson’s team said ""states have the ability"" to restrict and regulate foreign crypto mining operations. What is crypto mining? Cryptocurrencies involve a decentralized network of computers around the globe that track digital currency transactions. Crypto mining is the act of generating new ""coins"" when computers solve complex mathematical problems. Facilities that house crypto mining computers require immense amounts of electricity as the computers operate around the clock. Security experts worry about the risks these energy-gobbling computers pose to the U.S. power grid. But Hutchinson’s focus goes beyond energy to national security risks. In 2021, China banned domestic crypto mining, leading Chinese crypto miners to move their operations elsewhere, including the U.S. With support from Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Texas emerged as an attractive place for crypto miners to set up shop; the state offered a mix of tax subsidies, relatively low-cost electricity and incentives . How many U.S. crypto mining operations have connections to China? An October New York Times investigation found Chinese-owned-or-operated crypto mines in Texas and at least 11 other states. Collectively, the article said, these crypto miners use as much energy as more than 1 million homes. The mines the investigation examined included a Wyoming one near a Pentagon-supported Microsoft Corp. data center and close to a U.S. Air Force base that controls intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Times reported that Microsoft wrote to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States that ""the location could allow the Chinese to ‘pursue full-spectrum intelligence collection operations.’"" The article also said that some of the U.S. mining operations ""appear to be straightforward efforts by wealthy Chinese nationals to make money outside the purview of Chinese authorities."" But ""for others, the ownership is opaque, while several can be traced to the Chinese government."" Energy experts say these mines operate in a gray regulatory area. With concerns about Chinese government influence, some states are turning to foreign landholder laws as a possible model. On Dec. 13, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin, a Republican, announced that his office was investigating more than two dozen potential crypto mining operations. The move came in response to a letter from Arkansas Agriculture Secretary Wesley Ward, who said his agency believed that two companies — including a crypto mining company — were not complying with a recent state law barring businesses controlled by a foreign entity from owning land. Communist Party influence in Chinese businesses U.S. crypto mining operations that are part of China’s private sector could pose a risk of Chinese government or Communist Party influence, experts in China policy told PolitiFact. ""Many Chinese companies will have direct or indirect ties to the Chinese government,"" said Daniel S. Markey, a senior adviser on South Asia for the U.S. Institute of Peace. ""At the end of the day the state has tremendous power to control the activities of even the most powerful Chinese businesses."" These include very large state-owned enterprises, which are closely connected to the government, and privately owned companies. The Communist Party has been trying to tighten its influence on private companies. For instance, since 2018 the party has required private companies listed on stock markets to have a Communist Party unit, said Deborah Brautigam, an emerita professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies. According to Communist Party-provided figures, 73% of private companies had established party units by 2017, and among the top 500 private enterprises, the share exceeded 92%, according to research by the Centre for International Relations at Sciences Po in Paris. Party units within private companies historically have been tied to the recruitment and management of employees who are party members, but China’s President Xi Jinping has sought to increase the degree of party influence in private companies, experts said. ""If they want to invest overseas or do foreign trade, they need permits and approvals from various government agencies,"" said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, an international affairs think tank. ""They may not always be the government’s agent, but they will have to follow the government’s instructions and directions, or at the minimum not act against them."" Our ruling Hutchinson said China is allowed to do crypto mining in the U.S. A New York Times investigation found Chinese-owned or -operated crypto mines in Texas and at least 11 other states. Texas has offered tax subsidies, relatively low-cost electricity and incentives to attract the businesses. There are no laws that specifically allow countries like China to engage in crypto mining in the U.S. But a lack of laws prohibiting it means that it is ""allowed."" There are, however, federal safeguards, and some state laws protecting against foreign government-backed business influence. Arkansas is investigating at least one crypto mining company for not complying with a state law barring businesses controlled by a foreign entity from owning land.

"December 15, 2023",Donald Trump,"“Gasoline prices are now $5, $6, $7 and even $8 a gallon.”",barely-true,"Former President Donald Trump cherry-picked these statistics. Although some stations are charging $5 to $7 a gallon, about 99.2% of U.S. gas stations are selling gasoline for less than $5 a gallon, GasBuddy.com data shows. Not one of the nation’s roughly 150,000 gasoline stations is charging $8 a gallon.","For President Joe Biden’s critics, the summer of 2022’s record-high gasoline prices are a rhetorical gift that keeps on giving. During a Dec. 13 rally in Coralville, Iowa, former President Donald Trump — the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination — sought to compare gasoline prices on his watch to those under Biden. ""Gasoline prices are now $5, $6, $7 and even $8 a gallon,"" Trump said, adding that gasoline prices were ""down to $1.87 a gallon"" during his presidency. Trump: We now have gas prices at 5,6,7, even 8 dollars a gallon pic.twitter.com/TxMeNHTvjd — Acyn (@Acyn) December 14, 2023 Trump cherry-picked these statistics. For the vast majority of U.S. gas stations, his claim is inaccurate. Gasoline prices under Trump, Biden Gasoline prices are higher under Biden than they were under Trump. Federal Energy Information Administration data shows that the average gasoline price during Trump’s four-year term was $2.46 per gallon. During Biden’s presidency so far, the average has been $3.54. (These figures are not adjusted for inflation.) As Trump’s campaign staff told PolitiFact, monthly gasoline prices during his presidency never cracked $3 a gallon, while the price under Biden has exceeded $3 every month since May 2021, his fifth month in office. In June 2022, gasoline prices hit an average of $5.01 per gallon, a record high. Gasoline prices rose initially during Biden’s tenure because of the post-coronavirus pandemic recovery. As economic activity, commuting and travel rebounded, fuel demand rose faster than global supplies did, driving up prices. Then, in February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. NATO countries and allies sought to reduce purchases of Russian crude oil as a penalty. And other major oil producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia, largely resisted requests to increase production to fill the void, which hampered supply. Current gasoline prices Since its summer 2022 peak, the price of gasoline has dropped significantly: During the week of Dec. 11, the nationwide average per-gallon price was $3.14. Not only is the current national average far below the prices Trump cited, but it’s also rare to find any of the prices Trump referred to at an individual gas station. GasBuddy.com collects crowdsourced data on gasoline prices across the country, compiling granular pricing statistics from the nation’s 150,000 gas stations. On Dec. 14, GasBuddy’s head of petroleum analysis, Patrick DeHaan, said his latest data shows that no station in the U.S. is selling gasoline for $8 a gallon. DeHaan said one station has a price above $7, about 150 stations are selling a gallon for more than $6, and about 1,000 are charging more than $5 a gallon. Add up all of those stations and it works out to less than eight-tenths of 1% of all gas stations in the U.S. That means 99.2% of stations are selling gasoline at rates below what Trump said at his Iowa rally. Who are these expensive outliers? DeHaan says they are often stations in rural areas with few competitors. For example, one is a Vidal Junction, California, station at a Sonoran Desert crossroads near the Arizona border. It is charging $7.80 a gallon, DeHaan said. If you’re in Vidal Junction, ""there are not many options,"" he said. Outlier prices such as that one are not unique to the Biden era, DeHaan added. During Trump’s presidency, stations such as Suncoast Energy in Orlando, Florida — which is near an airport with thousands of returning rental cars a day — regularly ranked near the top of GasBuddy’s list of priciest gasoline, he said. ""These stations are extremely limited, and by no means are they representative of market conditions,"" he said. Also, gasoline prices vary by city, state and region, and some places have gasoline prices that are more expensive than the national average. California is always an expensive state to buy gasoline. The current statewide average is $4.46, and in San Francisco, the current average price is $4.50 a gallon. Still, neither the California or San Francisco prices come close to the ones Trump cited. Outliers exist on the low side, too. DeHaan said four stations in Colorado are currently selling gasoline for $1.99 per gallon. Trump’s claim that gasoline was $1.87 a gallon under his leadership The lowest average weekly price during Trump’s presidency came the week of April 27, 2020: $1.77 a gallon, a bit lower than what Trump said at his Iowa rally. However, this needs context: That low price came early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when fewer people were on the road. This pushed gasoline prices to unusually low levels. By the time Trump left office, the average price per gallon was $2.38 — well below its current level under Biden, but still higher than the figure he cited. Our ruling Trump said, ""Gasoline prices are now $5, $6, $7 and even $8 a gallon."" Trump’s statistics are cherry-picked. GasBuddy.com data shows that about 99.2% of U.S. gas stations are selling gasoline for less than $5 per gallon. Not a single one of the nation’s 150,000 stations is selling gasoline for $8 a gallon. Because some stations are charging more than $5 a gallon, the claim contains an element of truth. But it ignores the vast majority of stations. We rate it Mostly False. "
"December 15, 2023",Ron Johnson,"Democrats have also used alternate slates of electors ""repeatedly in all kinds of different states.""",false,"An aide for Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said Johnson meant to say Democrats from multiple states have objected to past elections. Johnson went on social media and highlighted several situations in which Democrats have objected to election results — none of which match the original claim. For instance, in Hawaii in 1960, there were electors from both parties casting votes while a recount was taking place. The recount settled which party won, and there was no dispute when Electoral College votes were counted.","It’s been three years since a group of Republicans gathered at the state Capitol in Madison, with armed guards, trying to cast electoral votes for then-President Donald Trump, despite not being the official electors for the state and even though Trump lost. But U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., is still defending their actions — even after the group in a court filing acknowledged the group’s actions were used to try to overturn the election . In a Dec. 11 interview on CNN, Johnson was asked if Robert Spindell, who serves on the Wisconsin Elections Commission and was one of the fake electors, should resign from his position for participating in the scheme. Johnson said Spindell shouldn’t resign, there was an ""active court case"" and there were ""all kinds of irregularities in Wisconsin in the 2020 election."" ""In order to make sure that the case wasn’t determined to be moot, they had to have an alternate slate of electors just like Democrats have done repeatedly in all kinds of different states,"" Johnson said. ""There’s nothing untoward about what they did. There was nothing illegal about what they did. They were just an alternate slate of electors."" Kaitlan Collins, host of ""The Source wuth Kaitlan Collins"" on CNN, pushed back, asking whether he meant they did nothing wrong. ""These folks did nothing different than Democrats have done in many states,"" Johnson said. Collins then asked whether a person who participated in the fake electors scheme should remain on a state board. ""Democrat electors have done that repeatedly,"" Johnson said, ignoring the question. ""It’s happened in different states."" Is Johnson right that that Democrats have also used alternate slates of electors ""repeatedly in all kinds of different states"" In a word: No. Johnson’s response When we asked Johnson’s office to back up the claim, which created a lot of conversation on social media, spokesperson Kiersten Pels said ""the senator meant that Democrats have ‘repeatedly’ been denying and challenging elections for decades and cited the below examples in a tweet response to CNN."" But that’s not what Johnson said, and it’s not what viewers heard. If anything, it’s an acknowledgement that, at best, the senator misspoke. The response Pels referred to included four examples. We’ll take a look at them, through the prism of the claim Johnson made on CNN. They fall short. For instance, only one of the four even involves a slate of electors. 1960 election: Hawaii electors Johnson asserted: ""In the 1960 election, Democrats in Hawaii chose an alternative slate of electors, allowing JFK to be certified as the winner."" That election, in which Democrat John F. Kennedy defeated Republican Richard Nixon, is one of the most memorably close presidential elections in U.S. history. Here is some background from a Aug. 25 Politico article , which sought to debunk the same sort of comparison, which other Republicans were advancing. In December 1960, Hawaii’s election results were still in doubt. Nixon was leading by 140 votes with a recount underway. At the same time, presidential electors were meeting to cast their ballots, as law requires. Hawaii electors for both Nixon and Kennedy met separately to cast their votes for their respective candidates and sent them to Washington, D.C. The recount put Kennedy ahead by roughly 115 votes, giving him the state. The results were then certified and a new slate of Electoral College certificates were signed and sent to Washington. But the Hawaii electors were chosen, on the date prescribed by law, while the recount was underway and the result was still in question. In Wisconsin, the Republican fake electors met after a Trump-backed recount failed . A few days after they met the state supreme court ruled Joe Biden as the winner in Wisconsin . So, contrary to Johnson’s assertion, it was not the alternate slate of electors that allowed Kennedy to be chosen. It was the result of the recount. What’s more, Nixon himself — then the vice president — had slates of electors from both parties before him, and chose the Democratic one after the Hawaii recount was completed and certified for Kennedy. 2004 election: Republican George W. Bush and Democrat John Kerry Johnson asserted: In 2005, Sen. Barbara Boxer and Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones led a group of 31 representatives in objecting to the certification of Ohio’s electors. Those 31 include Jim Clyburn, Sheila Jackson Lee, Barbara Lee, now-Sen. Ed Markey, Benny Thompson and Maxine Waters. Johnson has the facts right, but applies them incorrectly to support his CNN claim. The Democrats objected to a rightfully-chosen slate of electors . They did not offer an alternate slate of electors. 2016 election: ""Rogue electors"" discuss trying to block Trump Johnson asserted: ""In 2016, Democrat electors from Washington state and Colorado signed onto an attempt to block Trump from winning an Electoral College majority."" When Trump won in 2016, defeating Hillary Clinton, many Democrats were upset at the results. After the election, Politico reported in Nov. 2016 , some Democrat electors were trying to rally support for other electors to not vote for Trump — this was what was termed ""rogue electors"" at the time. Likewise, some electors considered not voting for Clinton in states Clinton won. Again, this is not a slate of fake electors. 2016 election: More anti-Trump fallout Johnson’s final assertion: ""In 2017, Reps. Jamie Raskin, Pramila Jayapal, Barbara Lee, Sheila Jackson Lee, Raúl Grijalva, Maxine Waters, and Jim McGovern, all objected to electoral votes for Trump."" As in 2005, when the formal certification process was underway in Congress, some Democrats in the House objected to the electoral votes that were cast for Trump. Biden, then vice president, presided over the joint body, heard the objections and at one point told Jayapal, who objected to Georgia’s vote certificate, ""it is over."" Again, this did not involve a slate of fake electors. Finally, it is worth noting that after the 2020 election many Republicans objected to certifying various electoral votes for Biden. Indeed, that was part of the overall scheme — to have alternate slates of electors put in front of then-Vice President Mike Pence, so he could accept them instead of the legitimate ones. Johnson’s role with fake electors It’s worth noting Johnson will always be connected with the issue , based on a text exchange that was revealed by the U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack at the capitol. On Jan. 6, 2021, Sean Riley, a Johnson aide, texted Chris Hodgson, a Pence staff member, saying Johnson ""needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise."" ""What is it?"" Hodgson responded. ""Alternate slate of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn't receive them,"" Riley said. ""Do not give that to him,"" Hodgson said. Hours later the U.S. Capitol was under siege by Trump supporters hoping to delay the Electoral College vote count and overturn the election. Johnson has changed his explanation of his involvement from having ""no involvement in an alternate slate of electors"" to admitting he was made aware of ""Wisconsin electors"" by a Dane County attorney and facilitated a text message introduction with a staff member and the attorney . Our ruling In a CNN interview, Johnson claimed Democrats have also used alternate slates of electors ""repeatedly in all kinds of different states."" That is wrong. His own aide acknowledged that Johnson meant to make a different point, a more general one about Democrats objecting to past election results.

"December 14, 2023",Ron DeSantis,Florida “had a year-over-year reduction” in overdose deaths.,mostly-true,"Opioid overdose deaths were a growing problem in Florida for years before Ron DeSantis became governor in January 2019. The CDC told PolitiFact that Florida had 7,827 overdose deaths in 2021 compared with 7,611 in 2022, based on preliminary data for 2022. That equals about a 2.8% decrease. The state’s Coordinated Opioid Recovery, or CORE, provides a comprehensive approach to drug addiction. It expanded to 12 counties in August 2022.","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said that if elected president, he will send troops to the U.S. southern border to stem the flow of fentanyl into the country. He has vowed to use force and leave drug pushers ""stone cold dead."" CNN’s Jake Tapper asked DeSantis about his plan’s legality during a Dec. 12 town hall. DeSantis’ long answer covered fighting demand for the drugs, providing treatment and focusing on supply. In Florida, an opioid recovery network has reduced overdose deaths, DeSantis said . ""We're one of the only large states, in the country, where we can say we actually had a year-over-year reduction."" DeSantis did not mention a time frame for the reduction, but his campaign spokespeople said he was referring to a decrease from 2021 to 2022. Opioid overdoses in Florida declined slightly from 2021 to 2022 Opioid overdose deaths were a growing problem in Florida for years before DeSantis became governor in January 2019. According to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, Florida had an 8.2% increase in overdose deaths from 2020 to 2021, from 7,231 to 7,827. The majority of states also saw increases. Data the state publicized in August said Florida had a 4% year-over-year decrease in drug-related deaths. But a state health department official told PolitiFact that figure was based on provisional data that changes as it’s finalized. Now, preliminary 2022 CDC data shows a 2.8% decrease in Florida overdose deaths from 2021 to 2022. The CDC told PolitiFact that Florida had 7,827 overdose deaths in 2021 compared with 7,611 in 2022. The final 2022 mortality data won’t be available until early next year. Nationwide, provisional data shows that drug overdose deaths decreased by 2% year-over-year from December 2021 to December 2022, to slightly more than 100,000. For Florida, the 2022 decline in drug overdose deaths is the first since a decline from 2017 to 2018. Nevertheless, ""the crisis remains acute,"" Project Opioid, a nonprofit based in Orlando, wrote in September . Within Florida, drug overdose deaths decreased in some counties and increased in others. Brevard County cut overdoses by 49%, Project Opioid found . The nonprofit said the decrease seems to be attributable to a combination of widespread naloxone distribution, increased availability of medication-assisted treatment, coordination between health care providers and authorities to get people treatment and community education. The Tampa Bay Times found that drug overdose death tolls were still climbing in Tampa Bay counties, including Pasco, which had a 13% increase in overdose deaths from 2021 to 2022. The Florida reduction is ""small but promising and certainly in the right direction,"" said Brandon Marshall, ​​a Brown University School of Public Health epidemiology professor. ""At a population level, this reduction is consistent with experiences in other states."" Brian Tsai, a CDC National Center for Health Statistics spokesperson, said that the decline ""is not trivial,"" but it remains to be seen whether it’s statistically significant, and that can’t be determined until final 2022 data is available. Florida expanded opioid recovery program in 2022 DeSantis credited Florida’s opioid recovery network, called Coordinated Opioid Recovery, or CORE, for helping reduce overdose deaths. In August 2022, Florida expanded the program to 12 counties after it was piloted in only Palm Beach. The program takes a comprehensive approach that includes immediate lifesaving care, access to stabilizing care and other medical and social support services for career training, housing and food insecurity. Stephen J. Wilson, Project Opioid data analyst, said drug overdose deaths decreased in some counties after CORE expanded to serve them. However, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune found that in 2022, five of the counties in the CORE program had increases in overdose deaths. Our ruling DeSantis said Florida ""had a year-over-year reduction"" in drug overdose deaths. DeSantis was imprecise when talking with Tapper; he didn’t cite a timeframe. His spokespeople later said he was referring to a decline in overdose deaths from 2021 to 2022. CDC data shows that change was 2.8% based on final 2021 data and available 2022 data. But that 2022 data was provisional, which means that the final number still could change. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

There is no evidence that the ""great replacement theory"" is part of the Democratic Party’s platform, according to immigration and political science experts and a review of the party’s platforms from 1840 to 2020. Pro-immigrant policies are not proof of a scheme to replace white Americans with nonwhite Americans.","At a Republican presidential primary debate in Alabama, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy claimed he was the only candidate onstage who would ""speak truth to power"" and ""speak the truth to you."" ""Why am I the only person, on this stage at least, who can say … that the great replacement theory is not some grand right-wing conspiracy theory. But a basic statement of the Democratic Party's platform,"" Ramaswamy said Dec 6. The ""great replacement theory"" is a debunked conspiracy theory claiming that white people of European descent are deliberately being replaced with nonwhite people. Perpetrators of several violent attacks around the world, including the shooter who killed 10 people at a Buffalo, New York, grocery store in 2022, have referred to the theory. Immigration and political science experts said Ramaswamy’s claim is wrong and dangerous. And PolitiFact’s review of the Democratic Party’s campaign platforms from 1840 to 2020 show no reference to the ""great replacement theory."" The Democratic Party’s pro-immigrant platform is not evidence of the ‘great replacement theory' There are different versions of the ""great replacement theory."" The most ""explicitly racist"" version claims that Jewish people are manipulating ""high-fertility"" immigrants to come to the U.S. and replace white people through demographic warfare, said Casey Kelly, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln expert in political extremism. Ramaswamy is citing a more ""sanitized version"" repeated by right-wing politicians and pundits , claiming that Democrats’ pro-immigration policies are replacing white people in the U.S. and strengthening the party’s voter base, Kelly said. But there is no part of the Democratic Party platform that endorses or echoes the ideas of a replacement theory, said Eric Oliver, a political scientist at the University of Chicago. ""Ramaswamy is trying to interpret the party’s historically liberal immigration policies as wanting to get rid of its predominantly white majority,"" Oliver said. Alan Kraut, a historian and expert in immigration and ethnic history at American University, said of Ramswamy’s claim, ""That's absolutely rubbish. It's an attempt to create a racist theory out of something that's simply not there. And I don't think it should be taken seriously by anyone."" Ramaswamy incorrectly ties pathway to citizenship to conspiracy theory Ramaswamy’s team said a 2013 Politico article supported his claim. The article was about a pending immigration proposal in Congress that would have provided a pathway to citizenship to millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. Beneficiaries could eventually vote for Democrats, the article said, but it was uncertain ""what their turnout percentages would be once they gain voting rights."" The bill passed in the Senate with bipartisan support, but it did not get a House vote. Experts say that providing a pathway to citizenship for immigrants doesn’t prove Ramaswamy’s claim that the Democratic Party’s platform includes the ""great replacement theory."" Also, it was Republican President Ronald Reagan who signed into law the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the most recent law that paved the way for immigrants who were in the country illegally to become lawful permanent residents if they met certain requirements . Ramaswamy’s campaign also shared a link to a Ramaswamy Dec. 7 X post sharing a 2021 clip of CNN political commentator Van Jones during a Drew University forum. During the forum on ""the four crises facing the Western world,"" a university article said, Jones spoke about a ""diversity challenge"" as nonwhite communities grow and demand equality. ""No ethnic majority group in 10,000 years of human history that I could find ever went from being a majority to being a minority and liked it. And that’s basically the request from the racial justice left,"" Jones said in the clip. ""Is that we want the white majority to go from being a majority to being a minority and like it. That’s a tough request, and the reality is that change is hard."" Jones served in the Obama administration as an environmental adviser, but he is not a Democratic Party leader. Demographics are changing worldwide as more people age and migrate. The U.S. population also is racially diversifying . But equating demographic shifts to a sinister ""replacement"" plan is part of a ""paranoid style of conspiratorial thinking,"" said Kelly. For centuries, people have migrated to the U.S. because of violence, political instability and poverty in their home countries. Others have come seeking better academic or employment opportunities. Our ruling Ramaswamy said ""the great replacement theory is not some grand right-wing conspiracy theory. But a basic statement of the Democratic Party's platform."" Although the Democratic party generally is pro-immigrant, there is no evidence that it is the party’s platform to systemically replace white Americans with nonwhite immigrants.

"December 13, 2023",Fight Right Inc.,Nikki Haley “raised taxes.”,barely-true,"As a South Carolina state legislator, Nikki Haley co-sponsored a 2006 bill that raised the sales tax by 1 cent while also cutting property taxes. A university researcher analyzed the legislation and predicted that most homeowners would pay less overall in taxes. As governor in 2015 and 2016, Haley proposed coupling an increase in the gasoline tax with an income tax cut. The proposal didn’t pass during her term.","A political action committee supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Republican presidential primary aired a television ad that tries to link a rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, to former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The ad that aired in Iowa, by Fight Right Inc., opens with clips of Haley saying, ""The reason I got into politics was because of Hillary Clinton."" Then, a narrator says, ""So, Haley raised taxes like Hillary."" It is not an apples-to-apples comparison because the two politicians oversaw different types of taxes; Haley is a former state legislator and governor and Clinton is a former U.S. senator. But in this fact-check we will focus on the ad’s claim about Haley’s tax record. The ad cites two tax proposals: one to raise South Carolina’s sales tax and another to raise the state’s gasoline tax. ‘""These were tax swaps, not tax increases,"" Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, a group educating the public about tax policy, told PolitiFact. Haley’s sales tax increase was combined with property tax cut The ad cites a 2006 bill Haley co-sponsored as a state House member. It was signed into law and raised the state’s sales tax by 1 penny while also cutting homeowners’ property taxes for school operations. Sarah Young , a University of South Carolina, Aiken political scientist, said that the measure was presented as a ""tax swap."" Media outlets reporting on the bill used the same term. ""In essence, this meant that most homeowners pay nothing in school operating taxes on their property tax bill"" for a primary residence, Young told PolitiFact. Ellen Saltzman, a Clemson University research associate, analyzed the legislation in 2006 and concluded that most homeowners would pay less overall in taxes under the bill. Writing for the Strom Thurmond Institute of Government & Public Affairs, a research group, Saltzman found that the estimated property tax relief would likely be greater than the additional sales tax homeowners would pay, although the impact would vary based on homeowners’ purchases, home prices and tax rates for local school operations. Renters paid that sales tax increase but did not benefit from a property tax cut. Because the property tax relief was limited to owner-occupied properties and excluded commercial real estate, including rental properties, ""renters do not receive the benefit of the property tax relief,"" either directly through lower tax payments or indirectly through lower rent, Walczak said. ""Overall, the tax package was not a tax increase… but the 2006 property tax relief package prioritized homeowners and thus shifted more of the burden to businesses and renters, since they did not receive property tax relief but still faced higher sales tax burdens,"" he said. Some lawmakers and school officials objected to this bill from the outset, fearing it would remove a stable school funding base. Years later, South Carolina journalists found that the tax swap slashed property taxes, but the 1 penny sales tax increase did not make up for the lost revenue for school districts. Gov. Haley proposed a gas tax hike coupled with income tax cut The campaign ad also cited a September Fox News article that said that Haley as governor supported a 2016 state gasoline tax increase to pay for infrastructure. The article explained that Haley coupled her proposed gasoline tax increase with an income tax cut, lowering the top income bracket’s rate from 7% to 5% over a decade. ""I’m going to veto anything that is a net tax increase,"" Haley told reporters in January 2016. ""I’m just not going to have it when you’ve got $1.3 billion in new money. I’m not going to do that to the taxpayers of this state."" Ultimately, such a proposal was not approved, NBC in Charleston reported in November 2016. In 2015, when she proposed the same plan, Haley said that she would sign a gas tax increase only if the state income tax was reduced. ""If we do all of those things, we will have better roads and a stronger economic engine for our people. That’s a win-win."" A Haley campaign spokesperson sent us a 2015 article from the Post and Courier, a Charleston, South Carolina, newspaper. It said Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, which asks politicians to oppose tax hikes, wrote a letter in 2015 to South Carolina state lawmakers urging them to support Haley’s plan. Haley’s campaign spokesperson also sent articles showing that in 2014, Haley opposed a gasoline tax hike alone, saying there were other ways to increase infrastructure funding. In 2017, the South Carolina legislature voted to raise the gasoline tax while providing other tax relief, but that was after Haley’s governorship and during her time as former President Donald Trump’s United Nations ambassador. When contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Fight Right Inc.,the DeSantis PAC, pointed to minor tax measures Haley had supported that the ad did not cite, and were not what most people would consider a broad tax increase. One example was a lodging tax on vacation rentals. Our ruling A Fight Right Inc. ad said Haley ""raised taxes."" The ad points to 2006 legislation Haley co-sponsored as a state legislator to raise the state sales tax by 1 penny while cutting homeowners’ property taxes. Experts and journalists called the measure a tax swap. And a university researcher’s analysis estimated that with the change, most homeowners would pay less overall in taxes. People who do not own property saw a sales tax increase, but did not benefit from the property tax cut. The ad also cites Haley’s 2015 and 2016 proposals while governor to raise the gasoline tax. Again, it was not a stand-alone increase; it was coupled with an income tax cut. And the proposal didn’t pass, so taxes did not change. The statement contains an element of truth but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

"December 11, 2023",Ron DeSantis,"“Your minor child can go to California without your rag or without your consent, and get hormone therapy, puberty blockers and a sex change operation.”",barely-true,"Children younger than 18 in California require parental consent to receive gender-affirming medical care. A 2022 change in California’s interstate custody jurisdiction law lets the state issue a temporary custody order if a child seeking gender-affirming care comes to the state with a parent. A valid custody order from the child’s home state would still supersede the temporary order. Under narrow circumstances, a child might be able to get care without one parent’s rag, but lawyers and advocates say it is unlikely.","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that California makes it possible for parents to lose control of their minors’ health care decisions. ""Your minor child can go to California without your rag or without your consent, and get hormone therapy, puberty blockers and a sex change operation all without you knowing or consenting,"" the Republican presidential primary candidate said during a Nov. 30 debate with Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The claim was among many the pair hurled at each other during Fox News’ ""The Great Red vs. Blue State Debate,"" moderated by Sean Hannity and held in Alpharetta, Georgia. After the event, DeSantis’ team referred us to two news stories that referenced Senate Bill 107, 2022 legislation that Newsom signed into law making California a "" sanctuary state "" for families seeking gender-affirming care. The law’s proponents said it was written and passed in response to bills in other states that made gender-affirming care illegal or that threatened to criminalize parents who allowed their kids to access it. But DeSantis’ claim is misleading. Children younger than 18 still need parental consent to access gender-affirming medical care. But a change to interstate child custody law allows for narrow circumstances under which a minor could theoretically receive gender-affirming care without one parent knowing or consenting. But that is not how the law is constructed, and experts say the chances of that happening would be low. Parental consent is still required for minors to get gender-affirming medical care in California Can a 15-year-old get on a bus to San Francisco and get sex-reassignment surgery? No. ""In California, there is no provision for a minor to consent independently to gender-affirming medical care,"" said Lois Weithorn, law professor at University of California College of the Law, San Francisco. Whether a child is new to the state, or a longtime resident, parental consent is required for physical health care and Senate Bill 107 did not change that. California law allows some minors to receive outpatient mental health care without parental consent, said Weithorn, but not the pharmacological or surgical interventions that DeSantis described. DeSantis’ team sent us two articles when we asked for evidence to support the Florida governor’s claim. One came from the National Review, a conservative news outlet: ""Like the Pied Piper, California under S.B. 107 would entice children nationwide to leave their families and run away into the arms of California bureaucrats who believe that harmful drugs and sterilizing surgeries should be freely available to anyone who asks,"" the Sept. 7, 2022, article said. The other article, from The Center Square , a publication of the conservative-leaning nonprofit Franklin News Foundation, referred to a Sept. 20, 2022, letter that numerous groups sent to Newsom asking him to veto the bill. The letter incorporated a line similar to the one in the National Review about California becoming a ""pied piper"" for kids to leave the families in search of care. But California law does not permit minors to get puberty blockers, hormones or surgery without parental consent, experts said. What if a child is traveling with a parent? Among its changes, Senate Bill 107 altered the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act , a section of the law that outlines how different states determine who has authority to make a child custody decision. The Uniform Law Commission , a nonprofit organization working for the uniformity of state laws, drafted the law in 1997. Every state except Massachusetts has adopted it. By assigning a ""home state"" to children involved in custody orders, the act aims to prevent having competing custody orders from different states. Home states are typically where the parents divorced, the first custody order was issued or where the child lived for six months before a custody proceeding. That ""home state"" remains in charge of the case unless another home state is legally established. Generally, if parents want to modify custody orders, they must do so in the child’s home state. California, like the other states with this uniform law , has a caveat to account for extreme circumstances . In instances of abandonment, mistreatment or abuse, the law says a state other than a child’s home state can claim ""temporary emergency jurisdiction,"" giving it short-term authority to make custody decisions. Senate Bill 107 amended that portion of the law to outline another qualifying emergency circumstance: situations in which a parent — or person acting as a parent or guardian— and child come to California in an attempt to receive gender-affirming care. But a temporary emergency jurisdiction’s effect is narrow, experts said: It applies only to custody agreements that originated outside of California and only for a court-specified period, not forever. And the other parent is entitled to know about the court proceedings as well as the outcome, said Scott Altman, a law professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. The law lets the California court take temporary jurisdiction over a case, but does not automatically favor parents who support gender-affirming care for their children. If a California court takes emergency jurisdiction, it must contact the home state court to ""resolve the emergency, protect the safety of the parties and the child, and determine a period for the duration of the temporary order."" If a parent with a valid custody order files a motion in the home state, that home state jurisdiction trumps California’s. The uniform law mandates the custody order be ""enforced and recognized in the other states,"" said Courtney Joslin, a University of California, Davis law professor, ""and that remains true in California."" To summarize a complex process: A child involved in a custody dispute who is traveling with a parent who supports the child's request to receive gender-affirming care could be placed temporarily into the traveling parent’s custody (under emergency jurisdiction), but this wouldn’t override an existing custody order or jurisdiction from the child’s home state. If the child has no ""home state"" or existing custody order, a temporary custody order could last longer, Altman said. A narrow possibility There appears to be narrow circumstances under which DeSantis’ statement could have merit. If, for example, a parent and a gender-affirming-care-seeking child fled to California in violation of a custody order from another state, a court could take temporary emergency jurisdiction and issue a temporary custody order. The non-California-based parent would receive notice of the temporary custody order and its conditions, legal experts said. If the temporary custody order granted sole physical and legal custody to the parent in California and said that parent was not required to inform his or her counterpart of medical decisions, a child could possibly receive gender-affirming medical care without the other parent’s consent or rag. But there is no guarantee that a temporary order would remove the other parent from legal decisions or medical rag. Again, this law gives no legal preference to parents who affirm a child’s gender identity. The court must decide what is in the child’s best interests. It is possible that a temporary order’s conditions would require only one parent’s consent. But the other parent would know she or he had temporarily lost that right. If the other parent had a valid custody order from the child’s home state, this circumstance would likely be short-lived. The parent with custody could file a motion in the home state, and the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act mandates that the courts work together to enforce the existing custody order. If the other parent had no existing custody order from the home state, the temporary order could last longer. There’s one more condition that makes this a hard-to-imagine scenario: long wait times for gender-affirming care, said Kathie Moehlig, executive director of TransFamily Support Services, a nonprofit that supports families of children undergoing transition, and a sponsor of Senate Bill 107. The likelihood that a child could receive substantial care, or all the procedures that DeSantis described, within a temporary order’s time frame, would be unlikely, especially if the other parent has custody. Our ruling DeSantis said, ""Your minor child can go to California without your rag or without your consent, and get hormone therapy, puberty blockers and a sex change operation."" California law requires parental consent for gender-affirming medical care. The state altered its interstate child custody jurisdiction law in 2022 to let the state take temporary emergency jurisdiction over a custody case when a child arrives for gender-affirming care. But that change doesn’t automatically mean that parents who support the care will be able to exclude the other parent or guardian from decision-making. Such court orders are temporary and existing valid custody orders from another state would supersede them. Under narrow circumstances, a child might be able to get care without a parent’s rag, but experts say the conditions allowing it are unlikely. We rate DeSantis’s claim Mostly False. "
"December 4, 2023",Ron Johnson,"""In order to be a poll worker on the conservative side, you have to register through the Republican Party of Wisconsin.""",mostly-true,"Political parties prepare lists of names of people interested in becoming poll workers. Those nominees get first priority for open poll worker positions. But that applies to both sides, not just Republicans or conservatives. After that, it’s possible for unaffiliated poll workers — who apply through their local clerks — to fill the slots.","With the 2024 presidential contest less than one year away, parties are beginning to mobilize voters and clerks are starting their election preparations. That includes determining who will staff the polls on election days to help register voters, check photo IDs and explain how to mark ballots. In a Nov. 10 video posted to X (formerly Twitter) by the Wisconsin Republican Party, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said people concerned about election integrity can ""go home and mope"" or get involved to help elect Republicans. (Other PolitiFact Wisconsin items have debunked false claims of massive voter fraud and disproved persistent misconceptions about how the 2020 presidential election was administered in the state.) Johnson suggested that Republicans who want to ""restore confidence in our elections systems"" can get trained and paid as poll workers and said: ""In order to be a poll worker on the conservative side, you have to register through the Republican Party of Wisconsin."" His claim caught our attention, especially after local clerks were the ones trying to enlist poll workers amid severe shortages during the Covid-19 pandemic . If you want to become a poll worker, do you have to register through a political party? Let’s take a look. Poll worker positions are first filled through political party lists When asked for backup for the claim, Republican Party of Wisconsin Communications Director Matt Fisher shared a section of state law and memos prepared by the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Fisher cited Wis. Stat. 7.30 , which says that the two dominant political parties (Democrats and Republicans) are responsible for submitting lists of nominees to become election inspectors, another term for poll workers. Under state law, ""all inspectors shall be affiliated"" with one of the two parties, unless they are appointed as a greeter or if the party list runs out of names. In that case, the mayor, village president or town board chair can appoint a poll worker ""without regard to party affiliation."" Translation: the names prepared by political parties get first priority for the positions, but it’s still possible to become a poll worker without going through a party. According to the commission’s page on becoming a poll worker , voters who are active in a political party can reach out to their county party to be nominated for a two-year term. This year, the parties had to submit their lists by Nov. 30. Or, voters can contact their local clerk to learn about applying and become nominated on a nonpartisan basis. But it’s becoming less common for poll workers to be assigned through that unaffiliated option, as parties have been preparing longer lists of potential names, a Nov. 2, 2022, Wisconsin Watch article found . Fisher also referenced Wisconsin Election Commission memos that explain the state law and lay out scenarios to ensure that each polling location has the correct balance of partisan appointees. Our ruling Johnson said in the Republican Party video that ""in order to be a poll worker on the conservative side, you have to register through the Republican Party of Wisconsin."" Although it’s possible for people — even if they have conservative or liberal beliefs — to become nonpartisan poll workers by going through their clerk, it’s less likely they’ll get a spot.. Johnson was referring to people who want to become a poll worker on the ""conservative side,"" indicating they are involved in Republican politics and want to register that way. But the same is true of the Democratic side; it’s the way the system is built. Our definition of Mostly True is ""The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here. "

And they don’t even need to show their ID to do it.”",mostly-true,"It’s true starting in 2024 noncitizen residents can vote in local Washington, D.C., elections, but they cannot also vote in elections in their home country. Multiple municipalities allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. Even Wisconsin at one point allowed noncitizens the right to vote.","One of the perks of being a citizen is voting in local elections, but recent election cycles have put regulations under scrutiny. One such regulation has caught the ire of Republican Rep. Bryan Steil, who represents Wisconsin’s first district. On Sept. 28 Steil was speaking at an event for The Ripon Society on elections and his proposal, the American Confidence in Elections Act, which could change the guidance the federal government gives states on elections. It would also change who can vote in Washington, D.C., in local elections. At The Ripon Society event Steil said: ""Washington D.C., allows noncitizens to vote in the upcoming 2024 election under current law. That’s municipal elections. Think of the mayor of Washington D.C. That means, just to give you an example of how crazy I believe this law is, an individual who’s a Russian national, a Russian citizen, working at the Russian Embassy, after residing in Washington D.C., for 30 days, can walk out of the Russian Embassy, have their Russian passport in their pocket, walk down to a voting location next year and vote for mayor in Washington D.C. And they don’t even need to show their ID to do it."" We decided to take a closer look, with a focus on the core of the claim – can noncitizens vote in the municipal election, and do so without showing an ID? Is he right? What the law says In 1955, Washington, D.C., passed regulations on who can vote in local elections and for what races. The law has been amended a few times over the years, but has maintained central requirements for local elections: a person must be a resident of the city for at least 30 days, be 18 years old by the time of the election, and be a U.S. citizen. Pretty standard stuff. In 2022, the regulation was amended to remove the citizen requirement starting in 2024 for municipal elections. For federal elections a person voting in the district will still need to be a citizen. The amendment caused an uproar in the U.S. House of Representatives which passed a disapproval resolution 260-162, including 42 Democratic votes, which is required to change Washington, D.C., ordinances according to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. The resolution is in the Senate to be voted on and if passed, needs to be signed by the president to undo the law. Could someone working in the Russian embassy vote for mayor in Washington, D.C.? We queried the District of Columbia Board of Elections with Steil’s hypothetical. Sarah Graham, communications director for the District of Columbia Board of Elections, confirmed that the city does allow noncitizen voting starting in 2024 and there is no photo ID requirement. So Steil is basically on point, but his statement misses some information. Graham said via email that to vote in Washington, D.C., a person must be registered to vote; be 18 years old on or before the next general election; have maintained a residence in the District of Columbia for at least 30 days preceding the next election and not claim voting residence or the right to vote in any state, territory, or country; and not have been found to be by a court of law to be legally incompetent to vote. That part, not being able to vote in another country, was ignored by Steil in his claim. Under these rules, the Russian embassy worker can’t vote in Russia and fly back to the United States and vote for mayor of the District of Columbia. Also, the rule applies to people working at the Canadian embassy, the English and Irish embassies, the other embassies and other immigrants in the city. Steil singles out Russia, apparently for maximum rhetorical effect. Can noncitizens vote in American elections? Allowing noncitizens to vote is not as unusual as Steil makes it out to be: Multiple municipalities including New York City and San Francisco allow immigrants to vote in local races. In Takoma Park, Maryland, not too far from Washington, D.C., immigrants have been allowed to vote in local races for 30 years. In October, Takoma Park celebrated 30 years of noncitizen voting and released the most recent data on the city’s website. In 2017, of the 347 registered noncitizen voters in Takoma Park, 72 cast ballots, making up roughly 20% of those registered. Overall turnout in 2017 was 22%. Ron Hayduk, a San Francisco State University political science professor who specializes in immigration and political participation, acknowledges it might seem strange for a municipality to allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, but it’s not unusual or unprecedented in the United States. Even when Wisconsin was founded in 1848, citizenship wasn’t required to vote. ""Wisconsin was one of the states that actually made immigrant voting a really popular practice in American history,"" Hayduk said. ""Wisconsin allowed immigrants to vote before citizenship, not just in local elections, but also state and federal elections from 1848 until 1908. A big chunk of Wisconsin history where Germans, Irish, Swedish, Finnish, European immigrants, like many of the people in Wisconsin ... maybe their grandparents or great-grandparents actually voted before citizenship in Wisconsin."" According to the Wisconsin Historical Society, the original Wisconsin constitution determined noncitizens could vote. It stated: ""Persons not citizens of the United States who at the time of the adoption of this constitution were actually residents of the state and had declared their intention to become citizens of the United States and who shall have resided in the state (for) six months."" Part of the idea behind allowing immigrants the right to vote in local elections is allowing them to have their say in how local taxes, which they pay, are used. According to the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit immigrant advocacy group, in 2021 immigrant-led households in Washington, D.C., paid $603.1 million in state and local taxes. That year there were more than 90,000 immigrants in the city, the group says. The largest countries represented of that group include El Salvador with 9.7% of the immigrant population and Ethiopia with 6.5%. Our ruling Steil claimed ""Washington, D.C., allows noncitizens to vote in (municipal elections)"" so a Russian citizen, after living in Washington for 30 days can ""vote for mayor in Washington, D.C. And they don’t even need to show their ID to do it."" It is true that noncitizens can vote in local Washington, D.C., elections starting in 2024 and they don’t need a photo ID. But Steil fails to mention that they cannot do so if they are registered to vote in their home country and frames it as an unusual occurrence, when there are many other examples across the country. Our definition for Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here. "
