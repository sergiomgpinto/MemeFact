# MemeFact: Fact-Checking News with Internet Memes

> MemeFact is a Retrieval Augmented Generation system for creating fact-checking memes that explain verdict rationales in an engaging visual format. This research project demonstrated that meme-based explanations significantly reduced backfire effects (39.60% vs. 58.18%) and resulted in more effective belief correction (49.50% vs. 31.82%) compared to traditional text-based fact-checking. The system uses Large Language Models with the best results achieved using Claude-3.5-Sonnet at temperature=1.0 with the RAG variant.

## Repository Purpose and Structure

This repository contains the complete implementation of the MemeFact system developed as part of a Master's thesis at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Universidade de Lisboa. The system generates memes that explain fact-checking verdicts from reputable fact-checking organizations.

The repository is structured as follows:
- `src/`: Core implementation of the MemeFact system
- `config/`: Configuration files and prompts used by the system
- `data/`: Processed data from the Internet Memes Knowledge Graph and raw meme templates
- Study directories (`llm_judge/`, `llm_selection/`, `meta_study/`, `x_bot_study/`): Materials, code, and results from the four evaluation studies

## Key Findings

- AI-generated memes (using Claude-3.5-Sonnet) can surpass human quality on structural metrics like clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness
- Meme-based explanations significantly reduced backfire effects compared to text explanations
- Adding contextual information to memes is critical for their perceived credibility
- Self-evaluation bias exists in several SOTA LLMs when evaluating their own generated content
- Political orientation is the strongest demographic predictor of news veracity discernment
- 7.56% of targeted users deleted their misinformation posts following meme-based corrections

## System Usage

The system is built with Python 3.12 and uses Poetry for dependency management. The main command to generate a meme is:

```bash
poetry run python src/run_meme_fact.py --variant rag --config config.yaml --article URL --model MODEL
```

Where:
- `--variant` can be `baseline`, `rag` (recommended), or `debate`
- `--model` can be proprietary models (`gpt-4o`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, `claude-3.5-sonnet`) or open-source alternatives (`pixtral-large-2411`, `llama-3.2-90b-vision-instruct`, `qwen-2-vl-72b-instruct`)
- `URL` should be from supported fact-checking organizations: PolitiFact, FullFact, or FactCheck.org

## Important Files

`src/run_meme_fact.py`: Main entry point for the application
`src/rag/vector_db.py`: Implementation of the vector database for retrieval
`config/prompts.yaml`: Contains all prompting templates used for different models
`data/imkg/process/templates.csv`: Processed meme templates with contextual information
`LICENSE`: Project license information

## Datasets

The project has released three datasets available on Hugging Face:

1. [MemeFact Templates](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sergiogpinto/memefact-templates): 663 meme templates augmented with contextual knowledge
2. [MemeFact LLM Evaluations](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sergiogpinto/memefact-llm-evaluations): 7,680 meme evaluations from the LLM Judge Study
3. [FactCheck Memes X](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sergiogpinto/factcheck-memes-x): 119 meme correction posts and engagement metrics

## System Limitations

- First run requires approximately 11 minutes to build the vector database
- Only supports articles from specific fact-checking organizations (PolitiFact, FullFact, FactCheck.org)
- Requires API keys for language models
- No web interface or demo is available beyond the X bot account
- This is a completed academic project with no planned future development
